Then at 8pm, a daily summary will be found that tells you how many glasses of water you drank during the day. Simply start the app, and everything will be set up automatically. \r\n\r\nEach reminder notification has two options: \r\n'Yes' increments your daily count and creates another reminder in an hour on your timeline.\r\n'No' postpones the current reminder by 15 minutes.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT: 8-A-Day requires an active internet connection, so if you do not receive your reminders or the timezone doesn't sync, ensure you have a good internet connection before you open the app and wait for 30-60 seconds to ensure the sync is a success. (Don't worry, once it's set up you don't need to do this again until your timezone changes!)","developer_id":"55449d09e628714030000037","header_images":[{"orig":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/HHdpf6BuQKK0iqRJrb8f/convert?cache=true&fit=crop","720x320":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/HHdpf6BuQKK0iqRJrb8f/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=720&h=320"}],"hearts":129,"icon_image":{"28x28":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/vRYZABitQW2shJRNlbkd/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=28&h=28","48x48":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/vRYZABitQW2shJRNlbkd/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=48&h=48"},"id":"5544c004946ce2b650000037","latest_release":{"id":"5811e8acbd12f9d7ad000072","js_md5":"f83f750e9c67063bd96776ad2e96211a","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/EEmX1vXQqJdtoceH1hpw","published_date":"2016-10-27T11:45:00.556Z","release_notes":"Emery support","version":"2.3"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5544c004946ce2b650000037/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5544c004946ce2b650000037/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5544c004946ce2b650000037/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5544c004946ce2b650000037/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5544c004946ce2b650000037/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5544c004946ce2b650000037/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/5544c004946ce2b650000037"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/TdaLUI3CSmGJytN86ihG/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/TdaLUI3CSmGJytN86ihG/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-05-06T11:59:23.980Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/1Yc80GnbQ0Cvdq2ALH62/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/LfHAxwzRVCViE1RRyLxQ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/lXDg92RWOHd3uycy2Ajg/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/YZ6uQNaWQ5TsrOYgDGsJ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/KWdOiFMCQMmJm5KLJhhV/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"8-A-Day","type":"watchapp","uuid":"496c55d5-d722-4750-b46e-b99631bf6f48","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
