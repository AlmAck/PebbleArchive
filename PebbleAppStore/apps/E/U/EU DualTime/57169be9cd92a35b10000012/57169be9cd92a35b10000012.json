And no hassle, this watchface auto adjusts to summer and wintertime. A must-have for the holidays. Never call home at an awkward moment again!\r\n\r\nShake your wrist to show seconds in stead of the date (see settings). Futhermore an attention signal and icon, when bluetooth connection with your phone is lost.\r\n\r\nThe background colour of the local time indicates the battery level. Up to and above 30% green, up to 20% orange and less than 20% red.\r\n\r\nAfter downloading this watchface, go to settings (in the Pebble app on your phone) to set your home country and your temperature preference (Celsius or Fahrenheit).\r\n\r\nIf you like it, heart it ;-)","developer_id":"54df278891a09e5111000078","header_images":"","hearts":24,"id":"57169be9cd92a35b10000012","latest_release":{"id":"574728dd1d6a8803b2000012","js_md5":"3c97f68cc1fcf526b2ed3239ada746d6","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/ARwlC4OR8eEttj417Ycg","published_date":"2016-05-26T16:48:45.202Z","release_notes":"New layout.\r\n\r\nOption to switch on/off seconds in date field after shaking wrist.","version":"1.5"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57169be9cd92a35b10000012/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57169be9cd92a35b10000012/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57169be9cd92a35b10000012/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57169be9cd92a35b10000012/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57169be9cd92a35b10000012/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57169be9cd92a35b10000012/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/57169be9cd92a35b10000012"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/CV0TKD0TGmpv4VZ7Hn2g/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/CV0TKD0TGmpv4VZ7Hn2g/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2016-04-22T00:29:23.442Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/CV0TKD0TGmpv4VZ7Hn2g/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/pWjveZySGOYqSbdICRaw/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/WZz7tcE8R0OsrJI8xb5L/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"EU DualTime","type":"watchface","uuid":"30e01c92-30fd-4f93-b407-c84fce1a7135","website":"https://www.tisferry.com/pebble/eu_dualtime.php"}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
