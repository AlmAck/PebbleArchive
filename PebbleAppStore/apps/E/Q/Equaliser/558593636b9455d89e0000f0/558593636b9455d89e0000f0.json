When it reaches the end, a new column is filled in to indicate a complete minute.\r\n\r\nThere are a few markers to assist with readability. Orange blocks are displayed down the left hand side at every 2 hour increment. The orange horizontal marker represents midday. The black vertical markers are 15 minute increments with the thickest being half past the hour.\r\n\r\nExample: 3 rows are filled. A 4th is partially filled just past the first vertical black line. The time is therefore just gone 3:15am.\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy it :)","developer_id":"5575e66ebea9cc922b000050","header_images":"","hearts":11,"id":"558593636b9455d89e0000f0","latest_release":{"id":"5593ae6e85ea11583400002d","js_md5":"fd59bbd58c573c196e79f41923a76cd3","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/d7p4Dk5FQ72qqjrriN6S","published_date":"2015-07-01T09:10:21.358Z","release_notes":"- Added data persistence so that the second hand configuration setting is remembered when the watch face restarts","version":"1.5"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/558593636b9455d89e0000f0/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/558593636b9455d89e0000f0/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/558593636b9455d89e0000f0/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/558593636b9455d89e0000f0/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/558593636b9455d89e0000f0/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/558593636b9455d89e0000f0/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/558593636b9455d89e0000f0"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/FEgJKvEvQaqvTlB7v1mR/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/FEgJKvEvQaqvTlB7v1mR/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-06-20T16:39:37.154Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/FEgJKvEvQaqvTlB7v1mR/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/S1UoNj3UQ5SM3B2vcDPk/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/ITgbbvYRp2gYvI6rFvmg/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/2oqgM3h9T76oTWhZ0ZcQ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"https://github.com/chrismwaite/equaliser","title":"Equaliser","type":"watchface","uuid":"cb8e1551-1d33-4a80-a840-b0d088721291","website":"http://www.bytesizeadventures.com/"}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
