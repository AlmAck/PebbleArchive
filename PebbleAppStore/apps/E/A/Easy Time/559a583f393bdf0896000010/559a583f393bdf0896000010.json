How often does someone ask you the time and you look at your precious Pebble Time and you see 11:17 and have say eeh, it's 11:15!? Easy Time truncates the time in five minute blocks and shows 9 bars (on the top and bottom) which will indicate the exact minute, so you can still see what time it is exactly with ease :)\r\n\r\nThe watchface shows the approximate time, the actual minutes (in bars), the date (with abbreviated day name) and the battery percentage of your Pebble Time.","developer_id":"5307823ea7b6bad6fc000059","header_images":"","hearts":13,"id":"559a583f393bdf0896000010","latest_release":{"id":"559baa128f524fba63000014","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/WC5T6rzEQy3p7nKm9m0w","published_date":"2015-07-07T10:29:58.328Z","release_notes":"Fixed an issue where the time could be displayed like 11:??
