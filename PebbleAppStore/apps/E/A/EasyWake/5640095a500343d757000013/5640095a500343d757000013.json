Instead of almost having a heart attack every morning from your alarm, you can use EasyWake to wake up peacefully. EasyWake tries to slowly wake you up by sending short vibrations in a repeated pattern. It sends vibrations at 4:00, 4:20, 5:00, 5:20, 5:40, and 6:00 AM. All you have to do is leave EasyWake open on your Pebble Watch while you sleep. The app is set to fully wake you up at 6:00 AM, so you do not need to set an alarm on your watch. Wake up easy with EasyWake. \r\n\r\n*If popular request, I will add a way to set what time you want to wake up :)","developer_id":"541dcb218626aee98b00020c","header_images":[{"orig":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/VWPJAapxTfyLSuvIeyaV/convert?cache=true&fit=crop","720x320":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/VWPJAapxTfyLSuvIeyaV/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=720&h=320"}],"hearts":31,"icon_image":{"28x28":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/O8E2IFNxTKSMaa58NDEk/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=28&h=28","48x48":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/O8E2IFNxTKSMaa58NDEk/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=48&h=48"},"id":"5640095a500343d757000013","latest_release":{"id":"56401672ae3ac63f15000014","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/tjs0SuPhRUazYSSJg98E","published_date":"2015-11-09T03:43:59.773Z","release_notes":"Version 2.0\r\n\r\n-No longer requires 24Hour mode to be enabled\r\n-Removes dull text and replaced with the time\r\n-Bug fixes and improvements\r\n-Enjoy! :)","version":"1.0"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5640095a500343d757000013/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5640095a500343d757000013/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5640095a500343d757000013/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5640095a500343d757000013/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5640095a500343d757000013/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5640095a500343d757000013/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/5640095a500343d757000013"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/69TnK4O2Rd2Hbb3ek5yR/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/69TnK4O2Rd2Hbb3ek5yR/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-11-09T03:44:31.476Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/CMCUAQL0Rs3oTf4i5ajw/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/05nYGR3SRODDXGjWhu9B/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"EasyWake","type":"watchapp","uuid":"64972733-29f7-4567-a68c-66ee241ce168","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
