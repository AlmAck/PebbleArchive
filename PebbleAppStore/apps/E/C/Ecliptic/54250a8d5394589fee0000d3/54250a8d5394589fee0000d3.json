Use Ecliptic - it displays positions of the Sun, the Moon, stars and five brightest planets of the solar system that are visible with the naked eye. You can change the background color, enable hourly vibrations and lost connection notification in settings. The Sun is always drawn on top of the ecliptic circle. To the left of the Sun you see planets that are currently visible in the evening after the sunset. To the right there are planets you can see in the morning before the sunrise. Planets in the bottom part of the screen are visible all night long. \r\n\r\nLegend:\r\n☉ - Sun\r\n☿ - Mercury\r\n♀ - Venus\r\n♂ - Mars\r\n♃ - Jupiter\r\n♄ - Saturn\r\n\r\nThe Moon glyph changes according to the current phase. Planetary data isn't loaded from the Internet. Orbital elements of each displayed celestial body are built-in and all calculations are performed by the Pebble processor. GPS data isn't required because the Ecliptic code operates with ecliptic coordinates that do not depend on your current location (unless you are an astronaut in space far away from Earth). Background stars and zodiacal constellations lines are displayed. Stars up to 4.5 magnitude are visible, with respect to their actual brightness and color.\r\n","developer_id":"53e9cc82f4772adc670000ae","header_images":"","hearts":1038,"id":"54250a8d5394589fee0000d3","latest_release":{"id":"5629c75c853a3cf0bb000041","js_md5":"dd3cf9eb4daceddce2c850abec67ece9","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/keEanvPRc6XyZ8nLpMCx","published_date":"2015-10-23T05:37:12.317Z","release_notes":"Fixed a bug when the \"Hide stars\" option is not persisted between launches.","version":"3.1"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54250a8d5394589fee0000d3/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54250a8d5394589fee0000d3/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54250a8d5394589fee0000d3/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54250a8d5394589fee0000d3/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54250a8d5394589fee0000d3/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54250a8d5394589fee0000d3/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/54250a8d5394589fee0000d3"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/ojEuJr9jS6CpiEqvh0Fq/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/ojEuJr9jS6CpiEqvh0Fq/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2014-09-29T13:12:19.858Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/ojEuJr9jS6CpiEqvh0Fq/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"Ecliptic","type":"watchface","uuid":"40e2b243-7e1e-4f2e-bbe4-d2a6740017af","website":"http://ecliptic-pebble.blogspot.com"}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
