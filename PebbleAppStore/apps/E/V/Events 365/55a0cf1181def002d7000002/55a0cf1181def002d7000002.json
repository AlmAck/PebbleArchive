Events are cached so they can also be browsed offline (even when Pebble is not connected to phone). Sync interval can be configured so that app checks for new/updated events periodically.\r\n\r\nThe app will issue reminders 15 minutes prior to events (if you enable this in app settings).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if you're late to a meeting, you can reply with an \"I'm being late\" message. In this case you can select approximate delay (5, 10, 15, 20 or 30 minutes) and send the message.\r\n\r\nThe message is configurable via app settings.\r\n\r\nNotice: Only Office 365 Outlook events are supported, but not Live calendar events.\r\n\r\nNo companion app is required. The app is opensource, source code available on github.\r\n\r\nP.S. This app was NOT developed by Microsoft and is not affiliated with Microsoft.
