I designed it to enable quick access to data while saving swipes, clicks, and pushes. By sticking to mostly text, the watchface displays a large amount of data while limiting visual clutter. All eight complication slots can be filled or left blank as desired, and complications can be displayed multiple times.\r\n\r\nEight-frame has 12 weather and fitness complications, and most are self-explanatory. The exceptions:\r\n- Wind gauge displays wind speed in mph (Imperial / UK), m/s (Metric), or km/h (Canadian), and appends the bearing\r\n- Precipitation gauge displays chance of precipitation as a percentage, and adds a period or exclamation points to indicate increasing severity. A . indicates insignificant precipitation, ! indicates drizzle, !! indicates light precipitation, and !!! indicates moderate to severe precipitation. So, 45!! means that there is a 45 percent chance of light precipitation at some point in the next 24 hours, and 90. means that there is a 90 percent chance of insignificant precipitation.\r\n- Active calories burned refers to the number of calories burned while active as measured by the Pebble watch. This does not include sedentary calories or calories that Pebble did not consider as part of a workout.\r\n\r\nTo use the weather complications, you will need a free Dark Sky API key, available from https://darksky.net/dev/register","developer_id":"572e4fcf2ddb7cd2dc000001","header_images":"","hearts":132,"id":"579914491482cd5d4b0000de","latest_release":{"id":"580523edc988667eaa00000d","js_md5":"45852cd23613afea1e73c632d9b0a0ff","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/n1UJNPRfiPByTq5JHenA","published_date":"2016-10-17T20:43:31.354Z","release_notes":"- Pebble 2 support\r\n- Changed Pebble Time Round watches to show complications in rows of 3/2/2/1 instead of the previous 3/3/1/1\r\n- Changed weather update interval and how fitness data is computed in order to conserve battery life\r\n- Fixed bug causing relative humidity to appear when active calories burned is selected\r\n- Fixed bug in Pebble Time Round watches that caused the time layer's color to incompletely update when sending new settings\r\n- Various source code improvements","version":"1.6"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/579914491482cd5d4b0000de/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/579914491482cd5d4b0000de/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/579914491482cd5d4b0000de/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/579914491482cd5d4b0000de/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/579914491482cd5d4b0000de/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/579914491482cd5d4b0000de/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/579914491482cd5d4b0000de"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/tK06HtceQfWBU8pSifuG/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/tK06HtceQfWBU8pSifuG/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2016-07-28T04:27:07.438Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/tK06HtceQfWBU8pSifuG/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/MR6dvXTqSvemjyj0mZJm/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/qd1iQxVUS9uPc6jic981/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/rW746qTyNosrUrgCKvgX/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/lJoemNf2SjG8BnU453A6/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"https://github.com/aemacleod/eight-frame","title":"Eight-frame","type":"watchface","uuid":"514380ee-43e0-4c68-b3e6-f463f73fccac","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
