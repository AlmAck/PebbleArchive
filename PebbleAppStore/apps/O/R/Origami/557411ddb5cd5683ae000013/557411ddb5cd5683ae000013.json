Yes!\r\nReadability: medium\r\nExamples: 04:36, 12:59, 18:25, 20:47\r\n\r\nI spent some time with origami and I like the idea of creating different things with one sheet of paper. In origami you normally use square paper and for a nice effect the backside can have another color that comes to view here and there. I am using this effect to show the numbers. Since origami does not allow ripping or cutting the paper, the resulting numbers are pretty abstract, but always resemble their originals. You have to pay attention to the revealed brighter backside of the paper. The number 8 is an exception. Still, the paper has to stay intact. So I just folded the diagonals that represent the junction in 8's center.\r\n\r\nThis watchface is for fans of origami and those who like some arts on their wrist. \r\n\r\nDesign / Programming / Copyright Â© 2012, 2015 Sam Jerichow","developer_id":"54ed03c2d9c53b312f00010f","header_images":"","hearts":33,"id":"557411ddb5cd5683ae000013","latest_release":{"id":"5574178b4604f6bd68000014","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/NgBF891SRbCMKnNdqoeh","published_date":"2015-06-22T21:27:58.791Z","release_notes":"","version":"1.0"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/557411ddb5cd5683ae000013/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/557411ddb5cd5683ae000013/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/557411ddb5cd5683ae000013/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/557411ddb5cd5683ae000013/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/557411ddb5cd5683ae000013/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/557411ddb5cd5683ae000013/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/557411ddb5cd5683ae000013"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/ucy5RackRsCRMUt6ZvWT/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/ucy5RackRsCRMUt6ZvWT/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-06-22T21:28:03.298Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/ucy5RackRsCRMUt6ZvWT/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/ln2HRXkRI2RVj8KtxqAA/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/ia5onBpSyWA8yMDpoozQ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/4WkI7HFlTJWlqXVQ9r3A/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/ojiRqNTkS0KxenFIa1W9/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"Origami","type":"watchface","uuid":"35d73ce5-799c-499f-8228-39577579767f","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
