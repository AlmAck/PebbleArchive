Unfortunately, there's currently a bug in the Pebble black & white platforms (original Pebble and Pebble 2), such that the earth and moon image doesn't rotate correctly.  I'm hoping that the Pebble Store software will automatically select the older version for those platforms.  I'll release an updated watch face for those when the bug is fixed.\r\n"},{"version":"4.9","published_date":"2016-06-11T05:46:49.171Z","release_notes":"I'm being told there are some problems with this watchface when running under the latest OS.  I'm not seeing any problems on my own Pebble Time watch, but just in case there are some toolkit incompatibilities, I'm rebuilding the entire thing with the latest toolkit version."},{"version":"4.8","published_date":"2016-04-30T16:39:14.727Z","release_notes":"Increased the width of the battery indicator for Pebble Round watches.

The idea is that the planet orbits the sun every 12 hours and the little moon orbits the planet every 60 minutes. So, for example, the pictures here show the face displaying the times of approximately 4:58pm and the one with the numbers is displaying 4:53pm (actually shown at the bottom as \"16:53\").  If you configure it to not display the numbers, then you can get the numbers to display by simply a wrist snap.  The battery life is displayed via a simple line along the bottom.  The watch face also monitors the bluetooth connection and will buzz and display a bluetooth symbol if the connection is lost.  Numbers and bluetooth monitoring is configurable.","developer_id":"52f0112a949454fbcc00012f","header_images":"","hearts":42,"id":"52f81fc5cbdf71b4210005ff","latest_release":{"id":"583626d2ca3094bdc00000f2","js_md5":"0eec90156fc49f38357b3ce72c472c93","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/f4XCNJWqRPOQFcyfbSG6","published_date":"2016-11-23T23:31:44.525Z","release_notes":"Added \"Menu Icon\" and support for Diorite (Pebble 2).\r\n","version":"4.12"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/52f81fc5cbdf71b4210005ff/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/52f81fc5cbdf71b4210005ff/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/52f81fc5cbdf71b4210005ff/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/52f81fc5cbdf71b4210005ff/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/52f81fc5cbdf71b4210005ff/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/52f81fc5cbdf71b4210005ff/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/52f81fc5cbdf71b4210005ff"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/n06a7PbbQp6gMrIZx2YA/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/n06a7PbbQp6gMrIZx2YA/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-05-15T23:21:32.821Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/n06a7PbbQp6gMrIZx2YA/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/tmMjeUy1TamVOMiO1Seh/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"Orbits","type":"watchface","uuid":"92ac9db6-f0f1-444f-b122-41e927bef187","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
