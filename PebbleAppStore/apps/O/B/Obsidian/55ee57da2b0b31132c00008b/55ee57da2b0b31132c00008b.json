It's designed such that the watch hands never cover the date or weather information.  It's main features are:\r\n\r\n- High contrast colors, clearly visible in most light conditions.\r\n- Display of the current date (day and month) as well as day of the week.\r\n- The date display is never obstructed by the watch hands.  If they would cover the date, the date moves slightly to the side.\r\n- Display the current weather information (icon and temperature). Just like the date, this information is never obstructed.\r\n- Weather information in Celcius or Fahrentheit. Weather information source is configurable to use openweathermap.org, darksky.net, or wunderground.com.\r\n- Weather is displayed for the current location by default, but it is possible to set a fixed location.\r\n- Display of the battery level.\r\n- Change in background for low battery levels (yellow at 30%, orange at 20%, and red at 10%).\r\n- Vibrates when the bluetooth connection is lost or regained, shows an information overlay for a few seconds and keeps showing an icon when no connection is available.\r\n- Fully configurable, both in terms of appearance (colors, minute/hour ticks, etc.) as well as behavior (if and when to vibrate, show messages, etc.).\r\n- Square or round version.\r\n- Supports Timeline Quick View.","developer_id":"55ab3ca04f0cf8279e00003c","header_images":"","hearts":414,"id":"55ee57da2b0b31132c00008b","latest_release":{"id":"5841be93ca3094ca29000103","js_md5":"711b3277b8440d86d02a3a5f72b5ff40","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/K4CVpffSN2t1o50h3vsw","published_date":"2016-12-02T18:34:17.721Z","release_notes":"- Use temperature, not apparent temperature for darksky weather.\r\n- Respect quiet time.","version":"3.3"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55ee57da2b0b31132c00008b/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55ee57da2b0b31132c00008b/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55ee57da2b0b31132c00008b/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55ee57da2b0b31132c00008b/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55ee57da2b0b31132c00008b/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55ee57da2b0b31132c00008b/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/55ee57da2b0b31132c00008b"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/OY91vtsQeaTMF7VNklI2/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/OY91vtsQeaTMF7VNklI2/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-09-08T08:19:44.475Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/OY91vtsQeaTMF7VNklI2/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/7smNdOMIQB2pIxEN3O0C/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/kxrP12dRienginghdKwu/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/2k56UEeIRaCvej5fomMf/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/MuJ8uEsSdGsfyBzyWLWQ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"https://github.com/stefanheule/obsidian","title":"Obsidian","type":"watchface","uuid":"ef42caba-0c65-4879-ab23-edd2bde68824","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
