On bluetooth disconnect, the stars/fireflies disappear. To disable animation, simply give your wrist a vigorous little shake within 5 seconds of opening the watchface. Kind of a work in progress, if enough people download I might go ahead and add a separate animation for the daytime and tweak the existing animation a tad. \r\n\r\nRedrawn from Shovel Knight assets belonging to Yacht Club Games, no affiliation.
