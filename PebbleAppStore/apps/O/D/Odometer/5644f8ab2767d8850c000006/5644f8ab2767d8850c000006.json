From tenths of a minute through to the year, all fields \"roll with the changes\", just like an old style car odometer. Includes configuration of background color.\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: By default, this watchface is continually in motion which will have an impact on your battery life. A number of settings on the configuration page allow you to significantly extend your battery life by restricting animation when you're sleeping, only when minutes change, or only when your Pebble is tapped.","developer_id":"562271b7b701b522ee000078","header_images":"","hearts":65,"id":"5644f8ab2767d8850c000006","latest_release":{"id":"5654696373909a888200004c","js_md5":"f4baf413c75cab366db65015c28f89c1","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/ROxrjXz6RUO8yPsKmjca","published_date":"2015-11-24T13:43:08.312Z","release_notes":"Fix improperly \"fast scrolling\" digits.","version":"1.03"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5644f8ab2767d8850c000006/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5644f8ab2767d8850c000006/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5644f8ab2767d8850c000006/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5644f8ab2767d8850c000006/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5644f8ab2767d8850c000006/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5644f8ab2767d8850c000006/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/5644f8ab2767d8850c000006"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/ass1sbuYSQiRhkxuK3Df/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/ass1sbuYSQiRhkxuK3Df/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-11-24T13:43:23.776Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/ass1sbuYSQiRhkxuK3Df/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"Odometer","type":"watchface","uuid":"631bf369-35ed-4fc1-b43a-beef24c727a0","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
