A big digital readout would be the most easy, but that's boring; so I mixed digital and analog, and as this is a colour watch, why not use lots of colour? A new colour is revealed every hour (alternates dark/light). I've reduced the number of colours to the most contrasting, and it uses the same colour each hour (customizable with configuration page).\r\n\r\nI like it, hopefully you'll find it useful, too.\r\n\r\nSep. 18/16: Now works with Pebble Round.
