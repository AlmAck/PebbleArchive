Set a location alarm, then track the distance and direction on your Pebble. When you're almost there, the alarm goes off on your Pebble and phone.\r\n\r\nThis app is a must-have if you take public transit! For the Caltrain, Muni, BART, SamTrans, VTA, MARTA, DART, ORCA, MBTA, Washington Metro, Chicago L, SEPTA, PATH, Metro Rail, and any other bus, train, boat, or plane!\r\n\r\nIf you think creatively, it's useful for other things too! Use it for geocaching! Just enter in GPS coordinates into the search bar, and you can track the cache location with your Pebble. Another use is to see how far from your destination you are when you're biking or walking. Use it to help you get back to where you came from, like to find your car. It works without Internet, so you can use it on a plane to wake you up when you're near the airport. You can also use it to alert you when you're close to your destination if you're a passenger in a car.\r\n\r\nHave a question, comment, or problem?
