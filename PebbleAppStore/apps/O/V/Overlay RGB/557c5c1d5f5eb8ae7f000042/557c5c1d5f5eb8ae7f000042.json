There are helping lines in the background and a scale on the right side. Each third marker is longer and the sixth one is even a bit longer. I avoided numbers on purpose to keep the abstract appearance of the display. The width of the rectangles defines how to read: the wider, the later. That's basically \"left to right\", how you normally read. The rectangles are transparent so they create new rectangles in the mutual overlay area and therefore a new little scientific looking artwork as time passes.\r\n\r\nDesign / Programming / Copyright Â© 2011, 2012, 2015 Sam Jerichow\r\n\r\nThank you Nev Rawlins for your help!","developer_id":"54ed03c2d9c53b312f00010f","header_images":"","hearts":11,"id":"557c5c1d5f5eb8ae7f000042","latest_release":{"id":"557c5c6fdb598b7bfc000052","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/uZufP0QZTNG66schjGpE","published_date":"2015-07-20T07:51:33.860Z","release_notes":"","version":"1.0"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/557c5c1d5f5eb8ae7f000042/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/557c5c1d5f5eb8ae7f000042/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/557c5c1d5f5eb8ae7f000042/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/557c5c1d5f5eb8ae7f000042/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/557c5c1d5f5eb8ae7f000042/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/557c5c1d5f5eb8ae7f000042/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/557c5c1d5f5eb8ae7f000042"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/Dz8zefUUSuKIvtz0zoha/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/Dz8zefUUSuKIvtz0zoha/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-07-20T07:51:42.676Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/Dz8zefUUSuKIvtz0zoha/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/YO8p418nS0iWbpAugTAf/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/Oe0IhFDRiWH5kg4R0Ljg/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/tqIpHKqkTQCmDvB3otbj/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"Overlay RGB","type":"watchface","uuid":"5f165ea4-77a2-4a7c-ae50-03beeedab68b","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
