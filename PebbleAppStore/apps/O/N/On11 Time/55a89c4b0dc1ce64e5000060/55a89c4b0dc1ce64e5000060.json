It tells you how many steps you took and how much time you spent on sitting, walking, jogging, and sleeping (viewable through a companion app, coming soon).\r\n\r\nThe orange bar is your progress toward your daily Step Goal, and the green bar is for your Active Time Goal. You can configure both goals in the watchface settings.\r\n\r\nLive long and prosper.
