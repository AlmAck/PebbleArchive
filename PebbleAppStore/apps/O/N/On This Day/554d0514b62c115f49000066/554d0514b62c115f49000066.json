With loads of topics, from sport to film to politics - and more! This awesome app uses the numbersapi.com API to get events from the day selected. Also includes a 2 day backlog so you can check what happened in history on the past 2 days. Optimised as well as I could but further updates will be released. As always, if you have a bug, question, or simply want to say hi, send me an email at the address below.
