This is shown by default with the Never Settle slogan. Flick your wrist; Suddenly the time and date will be shown on the screen for approx 5 seconds before switching back. The date is shown within the OnePlus Logo area in the middle of the screen. In the screenshot, it's June 13 and the time is shown below as 23:29 in this case. The time supports both 12 hour and 24 hour formats.\r\n\r\nWhen the the 5 seconds are up, the watch switches back to the OnePlus Logo mode with a twist, it will show some random things based on my own experiences as a fan and being a member of the community. \r\n\r\nHopefully others find this as much fun and a novelty as I did thinking of it and creating it. There are a few extra things I'd like to put in but I wanted to launch this before the big OnePlus Three launch, because why not, and hey I made a thing...\r\n\r\nOh and, no, you don't need an invite in order to install this watchface!\r\n\r\nThanks ^_*\r\n","developer_id":"52f1f2f68811340e55001078","header_images":"","hearts":15,"id":"575f3adb8370899495000008","latest_release":{"id":"577c13276c2104a704000121","js_md5":"3423a494abb459e72dff03290e122d6a","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/9vwdvixpSr6mwZLSwiRO","published_date":"2016-07-05T20:10:39.180Z","release_notes":"- new. sayings and be enabled or disabled. off by default now.\r\n- new. added option to select one of few preset theme colours.\r\n- fix. an issue with crashing buffer overrun with one of the sayings.\r\n- new. added few extra sayings.\r\n- general tweaks.\r\n","version":"1.2"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/575f3adb8370899495000008/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/575f3adb8370899495000008/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/575f3adb8370899495000008/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/575f3adb8370899495000008/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/575f3adb8370899495000008/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/575f3adb8370899495000008/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/575f3adb8370899495000008"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/iSufwoGzRbyPRfwC59Je/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/iSufwoGzRbyPRfwC59Je/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2016-06-13T23:11:37.165Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/iSufwoGzRbyPRfwC59Je/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/W0kSLiQjShej59TTf1UZ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/M5mzGvPThC3BfTobpEpO/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/WAUNYePBSGCMg9XykwFI/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/dNwqOe6STHGxTEYRyhrC/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"OnePlus Life","type":"watchface","uuid":"e71435f5-87fe-4e67-9ec3-d78b5cf8349c","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
