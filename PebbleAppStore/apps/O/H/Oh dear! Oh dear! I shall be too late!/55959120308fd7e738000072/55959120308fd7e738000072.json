Oh dear! I shall be too late!\" ... but when the Rabbit actually took a Pebble watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a Pebble watch to take out of it, and, burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.\"\r\n... from Lewis Carroll's \"Alice in Wonderland\".\r\nTrust this watch face and you will most likely be 5 minutes too late! THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND... even if you are too late. Have fun...\r\nThe White Rabbit being part of the background image is work from John Tenniel.\r\nJohn Tenniel illustrated early editions of Lewis Carroll's \"Alice in Wonderland\" back in 19th century.\r\nMind that works of John Tenniel and Lewis Carroll are in the public domain yet!\r\nAll other portions of this Pebble watchface are MIT licensed.\r\n","developer_id":"55592fc6b038d44f9e00003e","header_images":"","hearts":66,"id":"55959120308fd7e738000072","latest_release":{"id":"559d9c17fbb136e2c0000061","js_md5":"f3ac1c977b68ef9230aee0a8412cb8db","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/Li2gCbBRPSCpIn1ckKZQ","published_date":"2015-07-08T21:57:37.242Z","release_notes":"Configurable watch face:\r\n\r\n* Show the second-hand (on / off);\r\n* Minute-hand behavior (sweep / tick)\r\n\r\nConfiguration settings are persistent.
