In 2013, front man Zach Alexander advanced as a solo act to the final round of Hard Rock Rising, a global battle of the bands. In 2014, OC expanded to include the talents of Nick Alexander, Connor Brown, Brady Haynes, and Tommy Hill. Since then, the band has gained recognition through their energetic performances and melodic, piano-driven songs.\r\n\r\nThe band self-produced and released the Red Dress EP in May 2014, which was followed by the release of the reflective single 'Go' and the smooth winter track 'Snow' in January 2015. Currently writing and recording new music, Ocean City continues to perform with genuine enthusiasm and strives to be a band that you put on repeat.\r\n\r\n//oceancitymusic.com//\r\n","developer_id":"548b1438f51abd3f5a0000c5","hearts":2,"id":"54de1c0e4d25e8223800009e","latest_release":{"id":"54de1c60adaf1db4650000b3","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/VbUgksBQhq0ErQctGgdw","published_date":"2015-02-13T15:47:04.099Z","release_notes":"Initial release. :D","version":"1.0"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54de1c0e4d25e8223800009e/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54de1c0e4d25e8223800009e/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54de1c0e4d25e8223800009e/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54de1c0e4d25e8223800009e/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54de1c0e4d25e8223800009e/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54de1c0e4d25e8223800009e/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/54de1c0e4d25e8223800009e"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/SmSvHUyNQwO6ziTpzqJS/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/SmSvHUyNQwO6ziTpzqJS/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-02-13T15:47:08.294Z","screenshot_hardware":"aplite","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/SmSvHUyNQwO6ziTpzqJS/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"Ocean City 1","type":"watchface","uuid":"13371337-1746-4411-a56d-5c24f8ff3731","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
