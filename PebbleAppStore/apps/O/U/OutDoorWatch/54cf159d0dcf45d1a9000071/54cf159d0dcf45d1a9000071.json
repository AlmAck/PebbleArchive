Rather additive the time, day and date (in nearly any language), the bluetooth connection as well as the battery state is shown on top e.g. the sunrise, sunset, estimated sun hours, your current GPS location, compass information, the wind direction as well as weather forecast, the estimated walked distance, counted steps or the air pressure forecast. InfoPanels are switched by accelerator control or in 60 sec delay. Shown are the current weather, a map with the day/night boundary, a weather forecast, a magnetic compass, a map of your current/ a fix location, the estimated distance interpreted by a funny picture, the air pressure or wind speed.","developer_id":"52caa21ed088ea211600005f","header_images":"","hearts":66,"id":"54cf159d0dcf45d1a9000071","latest_release":{"id":"5814715d46041fb22f00012d","js_md5":"18f932b0e3ec7aa7d06da26551e97d96","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/bf0wyfwBSjSAEvc2fvLA","published_date":"2016-10-29T09:57:36.799Z","release_notes":"* new app architecture\r\n* added chalk, diorite and emery support\r\n* new step and distance InfoPanel\r\n* a lot of bugfixes and improvements ","version":"3.0"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54cf159d0dcf45d1a9000071/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54cf159d0dcf45d1a9000071/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54cf159d0dcf45d1a9000071/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54cf159d0dcf45d1a9000071/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54cf159d0dcf45d1a9000071/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54cf159d0dcf45d1a9000071/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/54cf159d0dcf45d1a9000071"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/WkwTMAhRbybkc9Aezj1M/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/WkwTMAhRbybkc9Aezj1M/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-06-12T21:22:16.656Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/WkwTMAhRbybkc9Aezj1M/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/wy4t8doVTCSpL2Iq4Fhc/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/DMZpQ3ZgSKSPSiqsUpue/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/2GZYK1H0ScGSXFt6DZev/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/AYuEAvlyTQGUmISxNJZQ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"OutDoorWatch","type":"watchface","uuid":"18c93fb9-671b-4b87-b6ad-108738adbafb","website":"http://www.mobile-to-go.de/index.php?id=62"}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
