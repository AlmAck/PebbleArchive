Enjoy this seasonal watch face with xmas trees and snow flakes. The watch face acts as a snow globe and will animate every minute for a few seconds. Putting your watch reversed (e.g. put the glass against your lap) will also start the animation. If you like it, heart it ! :-)\r\n\r\nPS: the optimized routines should make this face battery friendly despite the animation.","developer_id":"52f053461ac7949119001436","header_images":"","hearts":24,"id":"5664c84d9be95e9108000066","latest_release":{"id":"56659b5519da61ed20000026","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/hZvhuwSXQbCC6dwq6eS8","published_date":"2015-12-07T14:46:14.113Z","release_notes":"new version with snow flakes and dots","version":"1.1"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5664c84d9be95e9108000066/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5664c84d9be95e9108000066/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5664c84d9be95e9108000066/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5664c84d9be95e9108000066/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5664c84d9be95e9108000066/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5664c84d9be95e9108000066/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/5664c84d9be95e9108000066"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/Q9uiQxJRxOP06kfHakMb/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/Q9uiQxJRxOP06kfHakMb/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-12-07T00:08:29.662Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/Q9uiQxJRxOP06kfHakMb/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/962P8LX2TJWEI7ZynYzt/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"X-Mas","type":"watchface","uuid":"4c272fcf-0079-4ee3-83cf-174888c041d0","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
