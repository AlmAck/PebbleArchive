I wanted to make a watchface that would load quickly on the watch, which was not the case with the Canvas watchface.\r\nThe 4 tabs of the original watchface were retained: Date with day of the week, Weather with location and icon, Battery status (only watch) and BT connection, and Time.\r\n\r\nv1.3 - Fixed date not showing correctly for 1-9\r\nv1.2 - Added settings page - GPS or user selected location and 째C/째F.
