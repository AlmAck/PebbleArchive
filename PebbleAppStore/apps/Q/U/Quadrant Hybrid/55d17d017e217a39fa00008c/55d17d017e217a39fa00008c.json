The additional 4 single minutes just inside that on the right.  The one of a 10-hour, appears on the left, just inside the 5-minute ring and the single hours are built from segments of rings forming sci-fi glyphs that are recognisable as digits, as with the 'Quadrant' watchface.  A central circle appears as the PM indicator.\r\n\r\nThere is a choice of colors for the hour digits, minute segments and the 5-minute ring on the settings screen.   There is also the choice of 2 pre-sets that use 3 colors for the rings, ignoring the number to be displayed, which makes it more cryptic.  Final choice is whether or not to display the PM indicator.\r\n   \r\nScreenshots show:  \r\n(1) 12:48PM - blue 5-min, cyan min, red hour\r\n(2) 09:57AM - blue 5-min, cyan min, red hour\r\n(3) 12:19AM - RAF Rondel (blue-white-red) \r\n(4) 12:34AM - Bull's Eye (cyan-red-yellow)\r\n(5) 06:51AM - cyan 5-min, green min, red hour (Quick View)\r\n\r\nThis watchface design was created by Peter Fletcher, from the UK, and is published with the designer's permission.   \r\n","developer_id":"54547c1fe77c14d0a1000033","header_images":"","hearts":145,"id":"55d17d017e217a39fa00008c","latest_release":{"id":"580ee60a836d3c5e0d000085","js_md5":"a5b52a516da151074a2bd59501084bf3","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/73rF5SrQOGcLvAbWR9AA","published_date":"2016-10-25T04:56:58.227Z","release_notes":"Adds support for Pebble Time 2","version":"4.0"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55d17d017e217a39fa00008c/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55d17d017e217a39fa00008c/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55d17d017e217a39fa00008c/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55d17d017e217a39fa00008c/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55d17d017e217a39fa00008c/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55d17d017e217a39fa00008c/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/55d17d017e217a39fa00008c"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/mbDSbYnjRmayWzHhBWzH/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/mbDSbYnjRmayWzHhBWzH/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-08-17T06:36:00.127Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/mbDSbYnjRmayWzHhBWzH/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/J51WdfWS2G5yb1w3CQeg/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/QseXgOapTJaysIGaaBE2/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/Af1UQYz8RhCsUw6Uuc5y/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/FbTbtXwmSluWnfC7J5qB/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"Quadrant Hybrid","type":"watchface","uuid":"eac9b29e-b5d7-4002-8218-5d99b580c976","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
