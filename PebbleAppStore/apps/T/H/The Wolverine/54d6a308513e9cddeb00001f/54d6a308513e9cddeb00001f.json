Wolverine is pushed to his physical and emotional brink when he is forced to go on the run with a powerful industrialist's daughter and is confronted -- for the first time -- with the prospect of death. As he struggles to rediscover the hero within himself, he must grapple with powerful foes and the ghosts of his own haunted past.","developer_id":"537a3ab276c2eda642000191","hearts":14,"id":"54d6a308513e9cddeb00001f","latest_release":{"id":"54d6a31ac9b17f4fee00002b","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/ZbCeyhsaQ6PBDdvEnCtg","published_date":"2015-02-07T23:43:35.674Z","release_notes":"","version":"1.0"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54d6a308513e9cddeb00001f/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54d6a308513e9cddeb00001f/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54d6a308513e9cddeb00001f/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54d6a308513e9cddeb00001f/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54d6a308513e9cddeb00001f/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54d6a308513e9cddeb00001f/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/54d6a308513e9cddeb00001f"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/2SS98WvKSROq4lg6FNaQ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/2SS98WvKSROq4lg6FNaQ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-02-07T23:43:40.770Z","screenshot_hardware":"aplite","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/2SS98WvKSROq4lg6FNaQ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"The Wolverine","type":"watchface","uuid":"13371337-9d73-4d8d-a543-7bf94ac65435","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
