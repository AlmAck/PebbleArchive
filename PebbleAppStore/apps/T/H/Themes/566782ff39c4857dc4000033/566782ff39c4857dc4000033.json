They all just started out as free HD wallpaper downloads.\r\n\r\nWhen you lose BT connectivity there is an option to vibrate.\r\n\r\nThere are 4 picture themes to choose from - landmarks, Space/Star Wars, Cats 'n dogs, people.\r\n\r\nTo see or force change to a new image it's easiest to just re-apply the settings. If no weather is received/available,  it defaults to the space theme.  If this is the case, hide the 3 circles!\r\n\r\nNOTES: I am not skilled enough to do personal image uploading (as other watchfaces have done in the past), and I do not intend going there.  If you know how and desperately want to add it, feel free to contact me.\r\n\r\nAlso, you may notice it takes longer to load this watchface - that's because I've pretty much exhausted the resource limit.  Please make sure your BT connection and /or WiFi remain stable during loading, otherwise it may fail.  If it does, just try again, it'll work!","developer_id":"52d76309bd61272345000001","header_images":"","hearts":302,"id":"566782ff39c4857dc4000033","latest_release":{"id":"578da26402f6d876f100002d","js_md5":"f39fb3d1152c775cfd3a1d696da15909","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/yYCOvFGVRO2P8yuRmhAj","published_date":"2016-07-19T03:46:02.980Z","release_notes":"fixed random\r\nrestored hour vibe","version":"2.0"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/566782ff39c4857dc4000033/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/566782ff39c4857dc4000033/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/566782ff39c4857dc4000033/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/566782ff39c4857dc4000033/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/566782ff39c4857dc4000033/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/566782ff39c4857dc4000033/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/566782ff39c4857dc4000033"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/6eNg3n2TPWL9bP9XRGvq/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/6eNg3n2TPWL9bP9XRGvq/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-12-09T05:25:37.616Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/6eNg3n2TPWL9bP9XRGvq/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"https://github.com/mereed/pebbleface-themes","title":"Themes","type":"watchface","uuid":"a78f1062-c85b-466a-aa82-f43ced1e2837","website":"http://markreed8.wix.com/pebblefaces"}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
