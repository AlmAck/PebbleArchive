Most notably, the text is always centered vertically, and a subtle analog feature is incorporated around the perimeter, with indications for local sunrise & sunset. With just a glance at these dots you can judge how much time is left in the day.\r\n\r\nComplete list of enhancements:\r\n*  Rather than \"Twelve O'clock\", it will say \"Twelve Noon\" or \"Twelve Midnight\".\r\n*  The time display will always be centered vertically, whether it is 2 lines or 3 lines.  The transition is animated.\r\n*  Single digit times can be prefixed with O' (same line), \"Oh\" (extra line), or neither, at the user's option.\r\n*  The day of the week is fully spelled out and shown in a large font, with proper capitalization.\r\n*  The month is abbreviated for space concerns at the bottom. The proper ordinal is used (e.g. \"1st\" rather than \"1\"). \r\n*  User can quickly switch between five color schemes (default, inverted, and three customizable schemes).\r\n*  A subtle analog clock feature is incorporated. A semicircle transverses the perimeter of the screen once a day, with midnight on the bottom and noon on top.\r\n*  Two dots along the perimeter identify the sunrise and sunset times. These are computed on the watch, not looked up from a service. To do this, it must determine location from phone's GPS; dots will not appear until this has completed successfully at least once. (Attempts made once a minute until first success, with updates requested each hour, unless disabled.)","developer_id":"531cd26a46b8f200dd000450","header_images":"","hearts":50,"id":"56ab1cfe6ca919990000000e","latest_release":{"id":"570dff02b175cf3ef6000013","js_md5":"265045454154d75afcdfe7b8d1f900e8","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/u6zbaBnzRzWSkI3gAArc","published_date":"2016-04-13T08:13:47.380Z","release_notes":"Corrected glitch that prevented color of sunset indicator from being set independently of sunrise indicator.
