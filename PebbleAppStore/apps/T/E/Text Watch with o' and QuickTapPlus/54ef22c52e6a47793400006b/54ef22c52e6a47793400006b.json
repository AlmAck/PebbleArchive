Watch also vibrates when disconnected.\r\nThe first ten minutes of each hour are shown with a leading o', e.g. \"nine o'seven\" instead of \"nine seven\"\r\n(Note: Phone location services must be enabled for weather data to work)\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to Andy Clark who made \"TEXT WATCH WITH UK-STYLE (DMY) DATE\". I used his source code in the making of this watch face.\r\nAlso thanks to the team behind QuickTapPlus","developer_id":"549cdc36cf9f6041eb00011e","hearts":33,"id":"54ef22c52e6a47793400006b","latest_release":{"id":"54ef258f565f03d6d5000079","js_md5":"f984a62265bfc161caf3f6f07dc86dd2","js_version":27,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/7wqRNYkRByMbhTbGyDdY","published_date":"2015-02-26T13:56:07.151Z","release_notes":"v 1.0\r\n- Initial release","version":"1.0"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54ef22c52e6a47793400006b/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54ef22c52e6a47793400006b/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54ef22c52e6a47793400006b/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54ef22c52e6a47793400006b/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54ef22c52e6a47793400006b/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54ef22c52e6a47793400006b/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/54ef22c52e6a47793400006b"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/KYBa1axXQ4a1s5av2FX4/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/KYBa1axXQ4a1s5av2FX4/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-02-26T13:56:13.756Z","screenshot_hardware":"aplite","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/KYBa1axXQ4a1s5av2FX4/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/dz3y5RTOSgWbQxA1Uzcq/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"Text Watch with o' and QuickTapPlus","type":"watchface","uuid":"dbe7a4b8-0413-41f6-9db5-439b28ed80da","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
