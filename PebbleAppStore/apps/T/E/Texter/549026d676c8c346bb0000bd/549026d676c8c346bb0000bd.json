Input based on Tertiary Text by VGMoose\r\n\r\nNavigation\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nThe app uses a navigation system whereby the action in bold is performed on a single click and the action not in bold is performed on a long press of the key. The back button returns you to the previous list.\r\n\r\nHow to Use\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nWhen the app is launched you are given the option to message either the last person who you had a conversation with or the first person in your favourite list. A long press on either takes you to a list of 6.\r\n\r\nYou can then navigate the tree of messages which you can customise on the companion app. Anything prefixed with a + means it is a sub menu. Anything else is a message that when you click will send the relevant message to the person you selected.\r\n\r\nText Input\r\n-----------------\r\nWhile in text input mode the inputs are changes to:\r\n\r\n* Single button press take you through the letter tree\r\n* Hold up to switch to caps and symbols\r\n* Hold down to go back to previous tree level\r\n* Hold select to send the message\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis app is open source: https://github.com/tocsick/texter\r\nTertiary Text: https://github.com/vgmoose/tertiary_text","developer_id":"548b8c076590af69fc000036","header_images":[{"orig":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/AkuTjF7SWOSAV0fYTfwM/convert?cache=true&fit=crop","720x320":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/AkuTjF7SWOSAV0fYTfwM/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=720&h=320"}],"hearts":520,"icon_image":{"28x28":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/0glDynUXQFORkgaur0BM/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=28&h=28","48x48":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/0glDynUXQFORkgaur0BM/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=48&h=48"},"id":"549026d676c8c346bb0000bd","latest_release":{"id":"54a214da85047c3e2b000017","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/VOKn7tuTJWdZpKXlZ37J","published_date":"2014-12-30T02:58:39.363Z","release_notes":"Added ability to combine messages with free type text Fixed bug with message combinations","version":"1.7"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/549026d676c8c346bb0000bd/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/549026d676c8c346bb0000bd/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/549026d676c8c346bb0000bd/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/549026d676c8c346bb0000bd/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/549026d676c8c346bb0000bd/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/549026d676c8c346bb0000bd/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/549026d676c8c346bb0000bd"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/Pa39T5vtR1apuTcD1UAn/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/Pa39T5vtR1apuTcD1UAn/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-01-01T23:44:25.010Z","screenshot_hardware":"aplite","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/cD8MSpWsRqCNx6HEhbK5/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/LmYRswU2RLSpBlgPYXEX/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/hPmsp5QiT6SjmUL0z8Dk/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"Texter","type":"watchapp","uuid":"7bac54b7-2359-4754-8947-8290444b45cd","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
