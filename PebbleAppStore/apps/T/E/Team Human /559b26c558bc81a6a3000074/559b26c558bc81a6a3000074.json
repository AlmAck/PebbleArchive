Sometimes we need a reminder of the game and what the teams really are. Inspired by gifted philosophers like Joe Rogan and Duncan Trussell.\r\n\r\nI built an app because my \"human teammates\" built a watch and then this whole software around it - that lets you make apps.

I love our team. \r\n\r\nI'll be honoring Team Human representatives with custom watchfaces and notifying them via twitter. There is no money in making these FREE watchfaces for me.
