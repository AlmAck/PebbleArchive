You switch between them using a sharp shake of the wrist.  \r\n\r\nThe first screenshot shown here is a stylised shot showing half of each face - to show that this is a 2-in-1 watchface.\r\n\r\nFor both, one line of the “X” shape displays the hours. The other line, divided into two by the hours, displays 5 x 10 minutes (bottom left) and 9 single minutes (top right).   \r\n\r\nThe two individual faces displayed are shown on the second and third screenshots.\r\n\r\nThe three screenshots show:  \r\n(1) 21:09 - stylised image - half digital/half original\r\n(2) 11:23 (original) \r\n(3) 23:58 (digital) \r\n\r\nThis watchface is published with the designer's permission, and sanctioned by Tokyoflash.   \r\n\r\nPete's original design for both versions (digital was in one of Peter's comments) can be found here: http://blog.tokyoflash.com/2014/05/28/type-x-watch-makes-its-mark-on-your-wrist/  \r\n\r\nIf you don't want both watchfaces, go for one of the single face versions - click on \"More from this Developer\", where you can also find other sanctioned Tokyoflash watchfaces.","developer_id":"54547c1fe77c14d0a1000033","hearts":10,"id":"54cbfe8eaa939af318000042","latest_release":{"id":"54cce1270a912f8eb80000b0","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/AJk0WgPQ3GuATjlJ6Dgo","published_date":"2015-01-31T14:05:47.305Z","release_notes":"","version":"1.0"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54cbfe8eaa939af318000042/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54cbfe8eaa939af318000042/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54cbfe8eaa939af318000042/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54cbfe8eaa939af318000042/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54cbfe8eaa939af318000042/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54cbfe8eaa939af318000042/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/54cbfe8eaa939af318000042"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/R5lYOquCQ3qpScX5TCsB/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/R5lYOquCQ3qpScX5TCsB/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-01-31T14:06:19.765Z","screenshot_hardware":"aplite","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/R5lYOquCQ3qpScX5TCsB/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/NMb4ZSvdSGSSiInUe404/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/MaXTkJFATm2xtA3WpTdA/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"Type-Xchange","type":"watchface","uuid":"16496f0e-7e26-413b-bb05-7a4345db8e33","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
