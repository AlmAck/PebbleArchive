The inner disk is the hour \"hand\" and the outer ring is the minute \"hand\". For example, the first screenshot reads 12:00 and the second screenshot reads 10:10.\r\n\r\nThis watchface is an attempt to emulate the i-Toc watch. You can see more about the i-Toc at http://www.i-toc.com/\r\n\r\nI have no affiliation with i-Toc and am not trying to make any money from the distribution of this watchface. Please contact me if you make i-Toc and want me to remove this from the store.","developer_id":"52f01a571ac794fac8000086","hearts":22,"id":"54ecd476d9c53bc88a0000d5","latest_release":{"id":"54eed3142365a41ca5000044","js_md5":"06b40ba2d570fa3dd0049e24ae8bcf01","js_version":27,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/Za5ndGV9Q1mzdEMJhNSq","published_date":"2015-02-26T19:46:36.064Z","release_notes":"Added hourly vibration\r\nAdded configuration for hourly vibration","version":"2.3"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54ecd476d9c53bc88a0000d5/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54ecd476d9c53bc88a0000d5/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54ecd476d9c53bc88a0000d5/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54ecd476d9c53bc88a0000d5/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54ecd476d9c53bc88a0000d5/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54ecd476d9c53bc88a0000d5/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/54ecd476d9c53bc88a0000d5"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/fArYBTOpT0K4RvO6oZAA/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/fArYBTOpT0K4RvO6oZAA/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-02-24T19:53:39.374Z","screenshot_hardware":"aplite","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/fArYBTOpT0K4RvO6oZAA/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/UxwonGhXSWCCogiHnkTR/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"https://github.com/CupricWolf/Pebble-Toc2","title":"TOC for Pebble","type":"watchface","uuid":"0a88492a-12b6-4c72-8bd5-6e01993f0a58","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
