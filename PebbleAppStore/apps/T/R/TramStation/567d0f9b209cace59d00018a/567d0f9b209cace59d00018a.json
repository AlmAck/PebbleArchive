Be surprised what happens during a day near to a tram station. An intelligent algorithm controls the activity to take the charging level of the battery into account. In addition it's a smart watchface with a lot of information gathered from internet. Rather additive the time, day and date (in nearly any language), the bluetooth connection as well as the battery state is shown. A tap of your wrist will in any case start a truck. It brings a billboard showing InfoPanels into the screen. The InfoPanels are switched in 60 sec delay or by accelerator control. Also a billboard at the trum bridge shows randomly selected short infos. Shown are the weather, the forecast of your current/ a selected fixed location, stock/currency values and up to 3 news feeds/ google alerts. But you can disable/ enable infos in the settings. \r\n\r\nHave fun! ;)","developer_id":"52caa21ed088ea211600005f","header_images":"","hearts":24,"id":"567d0f9b209cace59d00018a","latest_release":{"id":"56a7be0c6178cfb64a00003e","js_md5":"769bdb534fb0e9461aad8d29b90eca5d","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/rbYIuOnRgWK7yD3ZaGo8","published_date":"2016-01-26T18:42:38.697Z","release_notes":"* added russian language\r\n* intelligent activity mgmt. according the remaining battery charging level\r\n* small refactoring\r\n* some optimizations","version":"1.1"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/567d0f9b209cace59d00018a/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/567d0f9b209cace59d00018a/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/567d0f9b209cace59d00018a/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/567d0f9b209cace59d00018a/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/567d0f9b209cace59d00018a/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/567d0f9b209cace59d00018a/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/567d0f9b209cace59d00018a"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/BKxavhllRciN5Dfz7e0h/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/BKxavhllRciN5Dfz7e0h/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-12-25T10:12:35.671Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/BKxavhllRciN5Dfz7e0h/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/Bn7YLlVQ5uUd12ldDeji/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/c6XWbJmSSE6DINIDurlF/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/UFLQ9ErdQgCjCpKUDT8K/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/BFuHRd6gRFu5WcB5hQnD/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"TramStation","type":"watchface","uuid":"0d0eb311-e202-4cfa-866f-618256be7c21","website":"http://www.mobile-to-go.de/index.php?id=107"}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
