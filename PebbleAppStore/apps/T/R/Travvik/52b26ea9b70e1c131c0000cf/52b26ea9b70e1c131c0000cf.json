This was because the js timeout was triggered almost immediately which blocked the correct http request from getting to the pebble watch.\r\nI added a better number selector because it can take 5 minutes to go from 0 to 3000. Turns out I had people going all the way to 7000... I can only imagine how much that sucked. The new version fixes that with a better number selector. I moved the number selector into its own module so it should be relatively easy to use in other projects.

New button mapping. See description. Near complete rewrite. Improved REST API so requests should be < 300 ms for much improved responsiveness. Old releases relied on downloading the entire JSON package. This release uses a new logic path that does most of the work on the server side. Removed the clock bar for visual real estate reasons. May come back in future releases (please let me know if you need it). Ground work laid to store favorites stops.
