Paired with the Triggertrap app for iOS, you just need a Triggertrap Mobile kit to connect your phone or tablet to your camera and you're all set to get creative.\r\n\r\niOS users can use the Pebble mode to trigger your camera remotely for perfectly sharp still life photos, or to make sure you’re in the group photo! You can also start and stop your timelapse sequences, or expertly control your long exposures with Press and Lock and Timed Release modes.\r\n\r\nJust pair your Pebble with your iOS device, then press the big red button in the Wearables mode to get started – it will even open the Triggertrap app on your Pebble for you!\r\n\r\nTo connect your phone or tablet to your camera, buy a Triggertrap Mobile Dongle separately, and check out the Triggertrap website for a list of supported cameras and for more information. Currently more than 350 camera models are supported, with support added for new cameras all the time!","developer_id":"52cb05f345ffdd55f300000e","header_images":[{"orig":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/UIdOtLbSQ9KoMlHja1jD/convert?cache=true&fit=crop","720x320":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/UIdOtLbSQ9KoMlHja1jD/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=720&h=320"},{"orig":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/SFweOvsT5G45DbuCJFAe/convert?cache=true&fit=crop","720x320":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/SFweOvsT5G45DbuCJFAe/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=720&h=320"},{"orig":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/KyfYAD9yT9uAoxAldZEM/convert?cache=true&fit=crop","720x320":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/KyfYAD9yT9uAoxAldZEM/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=720&h=320"}],"hearts":37,"icon_image":{"28x28":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/G277AjcARt2LkkGle7hv/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=28&h=28","48x48":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/G277AjcARt2LkkGle7hv/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=48&h=48"},"id":"52cb079345ffdd6857000014","latest_release":{"id":"52cebf8c988ec11e0b000043","js_md5":"93d7c80d3affc990a2eb0e78c612fe77","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/qZHwhd0gTVmnDoZBvQmN","published_date":"2014-01-09T15:42:31.904Z","release_notes":"Welcome to the first Triggertrap for Pebble!
