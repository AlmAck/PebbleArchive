This version is probably better than my PoppyTime face and includes customisation as well.\r\n\r\nFEATURES\r\n\r\n* allows customisation of the following elements:\r\n\r\n    hour hand: bigger circle closer to the center circle\r\n\r\n    minute hand: smaller circle on the outside\r\n\r\n    face: includes the outer square and inner circle elements\r\n\r\n    discs: the larger disc in the main area.\r\n\r\nYou can also set the hands to be solid or outlined as well. By customising each element you can create a variety of faces to match your mood, style and outfit.\r\n\r\n","developer_id":"52f1f2f68811340e55001078","header_images":"","hearts":57,"id":"57549097d69450c68400001c","latest_release":{"id":"579f42ad1482cd16ea000542","js_md5":"f92d74f041ee10fa87db35e7d7f25aac","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/f4saseDUSTu6P4Vkl8mQ","published_date":"2016-08-01T12:43:23.370Z","release_notes":"- removed donate button from configuration. after 300+ installs no one donated. but if you like to donate and buy me a beer or a coffee please send some change to https://paypal.me/torharrington\r\n- on square watches like Pebble Time and Pebble, the outer face portion can be coloured separately from the inner circle face piece.\r\n- minor tweaks","version":"1.2"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57549097d69450c68400001c/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57549097d69450c68400001c/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57549097d69450c68400001c/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57549097d69450c68400001c/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57549097d69450c68400001c/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57549097d69450c68400001c/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/57549097d69450c68400001c"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/ST73FXOeTZ6bci8qceQN/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/ST73FXOeTZ6bci8qceQN/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2016-06-05T21:08:04.406Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/ST73FXOeTZ6bci8qceQN/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/fv2vQKUTACzokjROO4BQ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/HMa9Z64TVe6FhXbbk4zg/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/A1l4T4IpQbmBbzO5IQqa/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/1mAMwR0LSRujHSkcrZ8C/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"Tricky Dick Nixon","type":"watchface","uuid":"7c66d983-1dd6-454c-a075-def0feaa7e45","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
