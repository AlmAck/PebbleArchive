This is the watch-face for you.\r\nFeatures 11 characters.\r\n\r\nWhy it's interesting:\r\nThe Japanese number system is similar to the Latin in that it is in base 10, the symbols themselves are different and 10 is represented by 1 character.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n10 = 十\r\n40 = 四十\r\n15 = 十五\r\n45 = 四五\r\n\r\nThis watch-face is based off big time so it is read left -> right, top -> bottom.\r\n\r\nTo invert:\r\nClick settings on the phone beneath the picture of the face in your locker, then the three lines, go to 'FOR CLASSIC PEBBLE'.\r\nThen check invert then submit.\r\n\r\nTo change the orientation so that 12:34 is displayed as:\r\n三一\r\n四二\r\nnot\r\n一二\r\n三四\r\ngo to 'ORIENTATION' and select your option.","developer_id":"53d6061911a2f84fcc0001b0","header_images":"","hearts":40,"id":"558c3322c066c8ba260000c8","latest_release":{"id":"55d50353561ca4455e00003a","js_md5":"1747158ed9afabe53546940e737158cd","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/lm9hUnL9Txi6SsoFIEQw","published_date":"2015-08-19T22:36:19.087Z","release_notes":"Added more accurate font","version":"1.75"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/558c3322c066c8ba260000c8/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/558c3322c066c8ba260000c8/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/558c3322c066c8ba260000c8/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/558c3322c066c8ba260000c8/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/558c3322c066c8ba260000c8/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/558c3322c066c8ba260000c8/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/558c3322c066c8ba260000c8"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/Mf9msfDKRsqvaCxhaMWj/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/Mf9msfDKRsqvaCxhaMWj/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-06-25T17:07:50.403Z","screenshot_hardware":"aplite","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/Mf9msfDKRsqvaCxhaMWj/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/sitAFGVBTRWvW0n5CVYH/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/TZ2J0bFGR3OxZ7Mshu0H/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"Traditional Japanese","type":"watchface","uuid":"76cdbe0f-6e2c-4011-a32a-8b6328b2f838","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
