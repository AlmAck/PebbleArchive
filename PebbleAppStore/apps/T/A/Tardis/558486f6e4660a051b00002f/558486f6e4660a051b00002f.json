I think I don't have to explain the TARDIS, right? I was playing around with some sizes and views and found the isometric view the coolest. Time telling occurs through the door windows. They change throughout the series, so this little adaption shouldn't be a sacrilege. I drew every pixel by myself, trying to achieve the best outcome for the Pebble Time. You can even read \"POLICE BOX\" if you look super close. This watchface also works for original Pebble but looks really good in color.\r\n\r\n This is a non-commercial use of the blue police box trademarked by the BBC. This is my own interpretation.\r\n\r\nPixeldesign / Programming / Copyright Â© 2015 Sam Jerichow\r\n\r\nBig thanks to Nev Rawlins who helped me making this become reality.","developer_id":"54ed03c2d9c53b312f00010f","header_images":"","hearts":390,"id":"558486f6e4660a051b00002f","latest_release":{"id":"562d3b6366dc164db10000cc","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/DQWYADySTijp5BWDpmoJ","published_date":"2015-10-25T20:30:29.455Z","release_notes":"For watch displays shaped like the cross section of the time vortex, this watchface is compatible now!","version":"1.1"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/558486f6e4660a051b00002f/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/558486f6e4660a051b00002f/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/558486f6e4660a051b00002f/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/558486f6e4660a051b00002f/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/558486f6e4660a051b00002f/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/558486f6e4660a051b00002f/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/558486f6e4660a051b00002f"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/m55oHtcDTAiGyltrE23L/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/m55oHtcDTAiGyltrE23L/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-06-19T21:49:03.726Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/m55oHtcDTAiGyltrE23L/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/Fw9swQRFQtWXk4Mu4DKQ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/9mQxZ2XISGy5GgU5oYEh/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/GtFX5XaJRNSNmYeLaDnv/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"Tardis","type":"watchface","uuid":"73ce09c4-58e3-4a2e-bb25-aa5ffc1da632","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
