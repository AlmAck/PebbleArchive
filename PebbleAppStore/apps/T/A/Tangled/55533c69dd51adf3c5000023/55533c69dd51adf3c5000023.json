You can easily tell the time by reading the top two digits for hours, and the bottom two digits for minutes.  \r\n\r\nThis will appeal to those who appreciate a geometric display that is somewhat cryptic, yet actually very easy to read. \r\n\r\nTime will display in 12-hour or 24-hour mode, depending on the watch setting.\r\n\r\nUsing the configuration screen, it is possible to change both the background and time colors.  If same color is chosen for both, watchface converts foreground to black or white to ensure it still shows.\r\n  \r\nThe screenshot examples show:  \r\n (1) 12:20 (cyan on dark blue) \r\n (2) 12:03 (green on black)\r\n (3) 12:00 (lilac on black) \r\n (4) 02:39 (white on black)\r\n (5) 21:59 (blue on white / 24-hour)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis watchface was designed by Heather Sable and originally appear on the Tokyoflash Design Studio.  It is published with the designers’ permission, and sanctioned by Tokyoflash.   \r\n  \r\nThe original design can be found here:  \r\nhttp://blog.tokyoflash.com/2012/02/01/tangled-watch-design-gets-the-time-all-in-a-twist/\r\n","developer_id":"54547c1fe77c14d0a1000033","header_images":"","hearts":68,"id":"55533c69dd51adf3c5000023","latest_release":{"id":"5827293336ac5a349900004f","js_md5":"73da779d0bb7d900e2e46c4cfe8d1e27","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/x7gEujV1T4GDlGwnElyJ","published_date":"2016-11-12T14:38:29.381Z","release_notes":"Added support for Pebble 2 and Pebble Time 2.
