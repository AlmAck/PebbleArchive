Let Table Tennis Tracker tell you where each player should be and also remind you when to change sides during your match!\r\n\r\nWant to check something else on your Pebble in the middle of a match?  No problem!  Table Tennis Tracker will remember where you were and let you continue from where you left off.  And if you give yourself a point and then your opponent calls a let, you can undo the score change.\r\n\r\nFinally, when your match is over, Table Tennis Tracker can even add your match result to your Pebble timeline.\r\n\r\nTable Tennis Tracker options let you choose between modern and pre-2001 ITTF rules and whether to play best of 3-, 5-, or 7-game matches.\r\n\r\nFor more info, please refer to the screenshots above or on the FrostyMobile.com website.
