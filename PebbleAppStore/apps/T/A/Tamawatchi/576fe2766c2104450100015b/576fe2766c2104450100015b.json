The poop no longer indicates a bluetooth deconnection but health inactivity instead. If the tama poop, that means the next evolution will be a bad one.\r\n- Sleep : Tamawatchi now sleeps to indicate a bluetooth deconnection.\r\n- Battery indicator : A new bar on top indicate battery level, a skull appear if below 15%\r\n- Evolution tuning : Evolution now occurs at 25% of steps or step average, whichever happens first. It was set on steps only before, which means you sometimes didn't get the final evolution on an inactive day. On top of that, if you get the good first evolution, it will now be harder to get the next good evolution and if you get the bad first evolution, it will be easier to get the next good.\r\n"},{"version":"1.2","published_date":"2016-06-29T21:04:59.503Z","release_notes":"- Added vibrate and poop on Bluetooth disconnect (poop looks weird with the egg or angel but hey, you gotta do what you gotta do)\r\n- Added secret character (or did i?)\r\n- Added PTR support"},{"version":"1.1","published_date":"2016-06-28T23:39:20.780Z","release_notes":"- Bug fixes\r\n- Step goal is no longer configurable but instead based on your day average\r\n- A lot of colors are now configurable\r\n- Changed egg image"},{"version":"1.0","published_date":"2016-06-28T17:09:00.494Z","release_notes":""}],"companions":{"ios":null,"android":null},"compatibility":{"ios":{"supported":true,"min_js_version":-1},"android":{"supported":true},"aplite":{"supported":true,"firmware":{"major":3}},"basalt":{"supported":true,"firmware":{"major":3}},"chalk":{"supported":true,"firmware":{"major":3}},"diorite":{"supported":true,"firmware":{"major":3}},"emery":{"supported":true,"firmware":{"major":3}}},"created_at":"2016-06-26T14:11:02.240Z","description":"This little Tamawatchi will live and die on your wrist.\r\n\r\nFeatures :\r\n- Evolve based on your step count and step average (represented by bottom bar)\r\n- Vibrate and sleep on Bluetooth deconnection\r\n- Battery indicator (top bar) with a skull beside the tamawatchi if you are below 15%\r\n- Poop if you are inactive\r\n- Date format and vibrations configurables\r\n- Customisable colors\r\n\r\nSome details about evolution : \r\n- There are six steps : egg, evolution 1 & 2 (always the same), evolution 3 (good or bad), evolution 4 (good, average and bad, different based on previous evolution) and death.\r\n- The two important evolutions (3 and 4) occurs at 50% and 75% of your step goal.
