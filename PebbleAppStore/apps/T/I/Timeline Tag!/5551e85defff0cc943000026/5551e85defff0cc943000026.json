This first tag will be easy to find, the subsequent ones slightly less so.... The tag will report your current score and rank. When you receive it, it will give you a selection of recipients to send the tag to. When you select a recipient, the tag will be sent to them, and you will be awarded the points value of the tag. \r\n\r\nTags start out worth 1 point, and their points value increments each time the tag is sent to a recipient. The more a tag is forwarded on, the higher it's points value, so make sure you keep forwarding them on! \r\n\r\nThe tags will arrive silently to some point on the timeline, so you'll have to keep an eye out to make sure you don't miss any. Any tags that drop off your timeline without being forwarded on will die. \r\n\r\nHint: Look out for your own ID in the recipients list for the tag - you could get more points by sending it back to yourself to do it all again! \r\n\r\nIMPORTANT: Timeline Tag requires an active internet connection, so if you do not receive your starting tag, ensure that you open the app when you have a good internet connection and wait until the first tag arrives.","developer_id":"55449d09e628714030000037","header_images":[{"orig":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/jezqy4hSom0ilOikewEY/convert?cache=true&fit=crop","720x320":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/jezqy4hSom0ilOikewEY/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=720&h=320"}],"hearts":48,"icon_image":{"28x28":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/09yDsmClQRWI3q6ruPnv/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=28&h=28","48x48":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/09yDsmClQRWI3q6ruPnv/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=48&h=48"},"id":"5551e85defff0cc943000026","latest_release":{"id":"5811f1cf43675184c8000081","js_md5":"d4ccfa7d66fce10dfbd6a4ae42089801","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/zX6v0QypTkionppypUg3","published_date":"2016-10-27T12:23:50.468Z","release_notes":"Emery support","version":"1.14"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5551e85defff0cc943000026/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5551e85defff0cc943000026/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5551e85defff0cc943000026/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5551e85defff0cc943000026/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5551e85defff0cc943000026/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5551e85defff0cc943000026/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/5551e85defff0cc943000026"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/Iwid2L3T5SNm6HS5MCBl/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/Iwid2L3T5SNm6HS5MCBl/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-05-22T11:44:27.993Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/GZpglITsSPC5AVSAQr2w/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/pk1J5GBQgeLAQJcWn0uA/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/t5kq4n5CTt6T3cAWXgV9/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/gtOqAc6SkGzYbJJsW7fw/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"Timeline Tag!","type":"watchapp","uuid":"a927ad19-3d63-4f37-b7b1-d4b47725a84a","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
