It also shows the time! Use the Settings page to select the location to view & to permanently display tide levels. Note that viewing tide information for a location in a different timezone from where you are located will result in incorrect time to next tide being displayed. \r\n\r\nIf you need another (Australian) location added, email & let me know.\r\n\r\nThe tide levels work as follows. On the side of the clock where the tide hand is (The Rising/Falling indicator makes this clear close to the high/low times) the levels are the previous level & the next level.  On the other side, are the levels of the following tide.  The up-coming level & the start level of the next tide are (of course!) always the same.\r\n\r\nIf you are showing Fort Dennison, the yellow dot on the tide hand indicates the magnitude of the tidal flow (difference between high/low). High flows have the dot near the outer end of the tide hand. This number (tidal coefficient) is not available from the BoM so is approximated\r\n\r\nThe extra segments at the 6 hour mark remind you that some tides exceed 6 hours. The hand will only move below 6 hours.\r\n\r\nNote that this data must not be relied on for navigation purposes.\r\n\r\nIn using this WatchApp, you are making use of tide predictions kindly provided by the Bureau of Meteorology.
