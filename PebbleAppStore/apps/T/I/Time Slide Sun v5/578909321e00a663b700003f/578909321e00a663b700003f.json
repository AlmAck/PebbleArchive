Again mainly doing this as a test so I have icon on my pebble app for screen.  Screen shot was from 12:10 pm local time which puts the sun just east of New York, due to local DST.  No configurations available. Just working on code and wanted a screen shot on my pebble. \r\n\r\nThank you David Gianforte for original map code!","developer_id":"54f25b84bc88df9cfc0000e2","header_images":"","hearts":12,"id":"578909321e00a663b700003f","latest_release":{"id":"57890da41e00a66bb100003d","js_md5":"3682f105587b6e8dc7222e50ce66ecc7","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/noiv7Z7HTOKLt1UtyZNo","published_date":"2016-07-15T16:22:05.905Z","release_notes":"","version":"2.2"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/578909321e00a663b700003f/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/578909321e00a663b700003f/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/578909321e00a663b700003f/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/578909321e00a663b700003f/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/578909321e00a663b700003f/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/578909321e00a663b700003f/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/578909321e00a663b700003f"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/W8uVqPwjRQmJ3DOHpzRe/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/W8uVqPwjRQmJ3DOHpzRe/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2016-07-15T16:22:08.692Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/W8uVqPwjRQmJ3DOHpzRe/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"Time Slide Sun v5","type":"watchface","uuid":"44daf8ad-31d0-40e6-a48f-ea70a96e240a","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
