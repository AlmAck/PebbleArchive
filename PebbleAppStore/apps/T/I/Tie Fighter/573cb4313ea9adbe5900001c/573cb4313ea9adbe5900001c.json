The center of the left wing lights up to show PM.\r\n\r\nBattery level is shown by the laser beams in 10% sections (repeated for the pairs of laser beams).  10 - 40% at the top (red laser beams being fired at the Tie Fighter from behind) 50 - 100% at the bottom (green laser beams being fired by the Tie Fighter).\r\n\r\nNote. When Quick Views shown the battery indicators are not displayed. \r\n\r\nScreenshots: \r\n(1) 12:59PM (100% battery)\r\n(2)  9:43AM (30%)\r\n(3)  6:26PM (70%)\r\n(4)  1:00AM (10%)\r\n(5)  8:24AM (with Quick View)\r\n\r\nDesigned by Peter Fletcher, who has designed watches for Tokyoflash and a number of the faces I have published.
