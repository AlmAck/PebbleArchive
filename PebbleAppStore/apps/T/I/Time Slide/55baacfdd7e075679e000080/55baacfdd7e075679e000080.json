The difference is I bold the current time which happens when the text is centered over the red indicator line.  By doing so there are no additional tick lines illustrating start/end/half/quarter points.\r\n\r\nIt takes a while to get used to as some people feel that the watch is showing the next hour/day/date/month because it is closer to red line.  However if you keep your eye to left of screen and focus on bold text you can then quickly see how close the current time is to changing.\r\n\r\nAlso added new font for status bar to add readability.  There is no battery level or bluetooth indicator, however if this gets a lot of hearts I will add these features and release source code.\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy seeing time slide...\r\n\r\nLink to black background version:\r\nhttps://apps.getpebble.com/applications/55c0ef42bb5a5b0640000068\r\n24hr version\r\nhttps://apps.getpebble.com/applications/55c15f34a736657ffd00007a","developer_id":"54f25b84bc88df9cfc0000e2","header_images":"","hearts":90,"id":"55baacfdd7e075679e000080","latest_release":{"id":"55c0ece3718511cbe5000048","js_md5":"3682f105587b6e8dc7222e50ce66ecc7","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/iYSax6ubRF2bxzcaXdSb","published_date":"2015-08-04T17:04:22.724Z","release_notes":"Now also works on Pebble, Pebble Steel","version":"2.0"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55baacfdd7e075679e000080/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55baacfdd7e075679e000080/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55baacfdd7e075679e000080/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55baacfdd7e075679e000080/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55baacfdd7e075679e000080/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55baacfdd7e075679e000080/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/55baacfdd7e075679e000080"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/Okbj5XQbRLqFQcsOQmhA/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/Okbj5XQbRLqFQcsOQmhA/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-07-30T23:20:37.751Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/Okbj5XQbRLqFQcsOQmhA/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/MX2rvP5oRRqsokHAeoKG/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"Time Slide","type":"watchface","uuid":"be18c918-27b9-41a2-98a4-0b18dca8556b","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
