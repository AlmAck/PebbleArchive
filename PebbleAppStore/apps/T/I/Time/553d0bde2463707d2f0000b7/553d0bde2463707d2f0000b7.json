Features include:\r\n- Current weather (updated every 30 minutes). Please see my other watch faces for a Fahrenheit version.\r\n- Day of the week.\r\n- Date and Month of the year.\r\n- A Seconds line which grows each second and wraps round at 60. It indicates how many seconds you are into each minute. E.g. if its half way filled, you're 30 seconds into the minute.\r\n- Time (12h or 24h).\r\n- A battery indicator at the bottom of the screen similar to that of the seconds line. A half filled bar represents 50% battery.\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy the watch face.
