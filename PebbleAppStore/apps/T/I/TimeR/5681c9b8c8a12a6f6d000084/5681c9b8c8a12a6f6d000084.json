Time up to 100 hours with 1 second precision! Simple to use and incredibly handy with features including: The ability to enter hours minutes and seconds independently The ability to go back (by shaking it) if you entered the wrong time (only works on timer input screen) A clear UI with a ring that decreases in circumference as time passes - being invisible when time's up It also shows the current time, the time remaining and the time it will be when the timer has run out Upon completion the timer will vibrate once a second until you shake it! It will also light the watch up every other second.\r\n\r\nCan be paused by pressing middle button.","developer_id":"53d6061911a2f84fcc0001b0","header_images":"","hearts":5,"icon_image":{"28x28":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/3wO4C7fSeqYtGtxmcNT2/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=28&h=28","48x48":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/3wO4C7fSeqYtGtxmcNT2/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=48&h=48"},"id":"5681c9b8c8a12a6f6d000084","latest_release":{"id":"57b22684bb85edbc760004e1","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/4TCxjMvSVmLXCkcK0mEd","published_date":"2016-08-15T20:31:07.959Z","release_notes":"Fixed bug immediately introduced with previous version.","version":"1.5"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5681c9b8c8a12a6f6d000084/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5681c9b8c8a12a6f6d000084/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5681c9b8c8a12a6f6d000084/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5681c9b8c8a12a6f6d000084/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5681c9b8c8a12a6f6d000084/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5681c9b8c8a12a6f6d000084/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/5681c9b8c8a12a6f6d000084"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/MmdPfloXToOxcdSoFSEB/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/MmdPfloXToOxcdSoFSEB/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-12-29T00:36:32.298Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/SETgIdTSbuk18ixTxSpQ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/j8R0vJlQu2ODYtfmK8mB/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"TimeR","type":"watchapp","uuid":"45590346-d6b9-4ae7-8acb-e036d199f624","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
