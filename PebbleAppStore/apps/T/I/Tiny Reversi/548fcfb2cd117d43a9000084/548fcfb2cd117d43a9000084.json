Reversi, marketed in the US as Othello and in Hong Kong as Apple Chess, is the classic game of surrounding tiles, flipping fortunes, and outwitting your opponent. Place a token that puts the other side's tiles between your own, and they belong to you. But watch that they don't get taken back again. \r\n* Grocery-line sized play: a game lasts only minutes, and autosaves on exit in case you want to come back later. \r\n* It thinks! Play against a devious tiny AI at four levels of difficulty. \r\n* Switch to 2-player and surreptitiously pass along your Pebble to another challenger wherever you are. \r\n* Press Back once for options, twice to quit.\r\n\r\n Bugs, comments, feature requests can go to @theoreticalb. Also accepting plaudits. \r\n\r\n(Note: I open sourced this with the MIT license. So if you'd like to use the code to make Pebble Checkers or Attaxx or whatever, go for it! I'd love to play).
