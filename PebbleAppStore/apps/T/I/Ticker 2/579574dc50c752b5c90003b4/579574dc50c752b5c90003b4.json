In the end I'd changed so much I've published it as a separate watchface.\r\n\r\nIf you give the watch a shake the analog face disappears and the time/date (as text) scrolls across the screen - then it switches back to analog mode.\r\n\r\nThe battery charge level is indicated by the central ring - it depletes as the charge level decreases.  When the watch is charging, the battery percent level shows in the middle, then disappears when not charging.  The battery ring changes to Red below 40%.\r\n\r\nThe settings page includes,\r\n\r\n- change background colour (analog & text)\r\n- change scrolling text colour\r\n- change hour hand colour (and the small 12 dot)\r\n- change second hand colour\r\n- turn the animation on/off\r\n- bluetooth vibe on/off\r\n- seconds hand on/off\r\n\r\nThe watchface also supports the Pebble app built-in languages (ie. for the scrolling text).","developer_id":"52d76309bd61272345000001","header_images":"","hearts":88,"id":"579574dc50c752b5c90003b4","latest_release":{"id":"579858ed1482cd16ea00006e","js_md5":"9977f026e442d0c798fa46af9d559e26","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/JBkRHmLTYOL7KY1vNsKQ","published_date":"2016-07-27T06:52:45.685Z","release_notes":"option to disable pattern on analog screen\r\nremoved inner black circle\r\nbatt charging text same colour as scroll text","version":"1.1"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/579574dc50c752b5c90003b4/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/579574dc50c752b5c90003b4/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/579574dc50c752b5c90003b4/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/579574dc50c752b5c90003b4/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/579574dc50c752b5c90003b4/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/579574dc50c752b5c90003b4/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/579574dc50c752b5c90003b4"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/rl0JwewkSlCsiXmRQN1u/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/rl0JwewkSlCsiXmRQN1u/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2016-07-26T03:01:56.877Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/rl0JwewkSlCsiXmRQN1u/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"https://github.com/mereed/pebbleface-ticke2","title":"Ticker 2","type":"watchface","uuid":"16e98366-a436-473e-afd1-6b0464bdb264","website":"http://markreed8.wix.com/pebblefaces"}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
