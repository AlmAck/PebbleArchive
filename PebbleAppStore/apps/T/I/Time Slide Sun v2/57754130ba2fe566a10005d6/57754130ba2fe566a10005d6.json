Again mainly doing this so I have icon on my pebble app for screen.\r\n\r\nScreen shot was from 12:01pm local time which is an hour away from sun being above New York due to DST.\r\n\r\nNo configurations available. Just working on code and wanted a screen shot on my pebble. Thank you David Gianforte for original map code!","developer_id":"54f25b84bc88df9cfc0000e2","header_images":"","hearts":13,"id":"57754130ba2fe566a10005d6","latest_release":{"id":"577541576c2104d9b1000576","js_md5":"3682f105587b6e8dc7222e50ce66ecc7","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/MbQenRtQWGxW6GuJFUAG","published_date":"2016-06-30T16:02:07.268Z","release_notes":"1.8","version":"1.8"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57754130ba2fe566a10005d6/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57754130ba2fe566a10005d6/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57754130ba2fe566a10005d6/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57754130ba2fe566a10005d6/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57754130ba2fe566a10005d6/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57754130ba2fe566a10005d6/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/57754130ba2fe566a10005d6"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/gzRzCIqTSFalukpBczdH/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/gzRzCIqTSFalukpBczdH/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2016-06-30T16:02:24.698Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/gzRzCIqTSFalukpBczdH/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"Time Slide Sun v2","type":"watchface","uuid":"c87c24f2-d0f0-4fe9-ac56-dbb867c40c4c","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
