The top two sections of the watchface represent the first and second digits of the hour and the bottom two sections represent the first and second digits of the minute.  If no lights are lit, that represents 0, if 1 light is lit that represents 1 and so on.  For example, if the first digit of the hour has one light lit and no other sections have any lights lit you are looking at 10:00.  In the included screenshots, the first one is showing 19:27, the second is showing 19:28 and the third is showing 7:30.  Every time the screen updates the lights in each section are randomly turned on and off. \r\n\r\nThis watchface has taken advantage of Slate and includes multiple customization settings allowing you to set the color of the digits as well as the background.  You can also hide the unlit squares in each section (always black) as well as changing how often the screen is updated.  The 24/12 hour display is based on the settings on your watch.
