It's fun and it's motivating to be active.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you current step count is 9225 at 10:20pm today and your yesterday step count was 9137 at the same time yesterday, you would see an up arrow with a positive change of 88. However, once you stop being active, you may turn to a down arrow later in the day.","developer_id":"5481b9a1d581a17236000037","header_images":"","hearts":70,"id":"56c9c683f3e1f79308000030","latest_release":{"id":"57d9659fa789e13d480007dd","js_md5":"b5ddd39943a4c890b73b292a3498de29","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/1zEj0RlCQc6bRcjOydP1","published_date":"2016-09-14T15:19:20.571Z","release_notes":"1.
