Walk around for a little bit and Link changes to a walking pose.  Pass your daily average and he changes to \"Touchdown Link\".

Full hearts give you walking Link.  The level of activity needed to fill the hearts is configurable.\r\n\r\nA dungeon key indicates Bluetooth connection.  A short vibration playing the Zelda theme indicates the connection has been lost.\r\n\r\nTemperature (C/F) and Time (12/24) are configurable.\r\n\r\n**NOTE THE LATEST FIRMWARE (3.9) IS REQUIRED FOR ACCESSING HEALTH DATA**","developer_id":"52f00ca61ac79451370000d1","header_images":"","hearts":63,"id":"56bc06e0101f0509bd000044","latest_release":{"id":"57f5a3674529f5ebaa000065","js_md5":"39fa85706f58fcbe4020fcf130e499b8","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/sir1O0zSF6Bmj3udCWZZ","published_date":"2016-10-06T01:06:07.884Z","release_notes":"New features for SDK 4.0 and Pebble 2!
