Inspired by LED watches produced by Kisai / TokyoFlash.com, this watchface consists of digital segments arranged in a hexagonal form.\r\n\r\nThe time is read in the same manner as a conventional analog clock. Additionally, an AM/PM indicator occupies the centre, pointing up for AM and down for PM.\r\n\r\nThis watchface can be configured to show the date, as well as toggle the animation that is triggered on every minute transition.\r\n\r\nAlso available for original Pebble and Pebble Steel smartwatches.","developer_id":"54ed99889e4ff738b200004b","header_images":"","hearts":32,"id":"5551e8d971c40d9b74000017","latest_release":{"id":"55800d6761728741a2000009","js_md5":"1d476a6ff69d5f7649082f2c6018f4e5","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/Rk0UKdCSN6c6lcQ6NEQ2","published_date":"2015-06-16T11:51:51.219Z","release_notes":"Resolved issues causing crashes on Pebble Time; Added icon for the Watchfaces menu.","version":"1.2"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5551e8d971c40d9b74000017/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5551e8d971c40d9b74000017/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5551e8d971c40d9b74000017/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5551e8d971c40d9b74000017/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5551e8d971c40d9b74000017/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5551e8d971c40d9b74000017/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/5551e8d971c40d9b74000017"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/q1raAVh7Qe2wrvSom7NR/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/q1raAVh7Qe2wrvSom7NR/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-05-15T13:40:20.741Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/q1raAVh7Qe2wrvSom7NR/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/8mJNWf3aTXWHTUChwaPJ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/TbS5NaxxTEmIuyZKJmKp/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/qJF5QpW2QPOcW1Sosnpj/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"Hex-An","type":"watchface","uuid":"0f017bcb-5257-491c-a639-251be45df1fe","website":"http://tech-and-arts.com/pebble/hex-an-watchface/"}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
