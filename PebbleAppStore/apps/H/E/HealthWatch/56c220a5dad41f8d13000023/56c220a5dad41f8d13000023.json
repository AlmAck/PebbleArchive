Under the cover – assuming the function is enabled in the pebble health app settings – algorithms detect steps, more vigorous movements resulting in a higher VMC value, sleep as well as restful sleep phases. Also active as well as retful calories consumption are tracked.\r\n\r\nThe new Watchface provides all this data to you put into configurable graphs. It’s up to you, what values over the time are interesting for you.\r\n\r\nIn particular the step count over the day is shown rated by a (funny) icon showing you e.g. a fat cat sitting in front of its TV, in case a low step count was measured. ;)\r\n\r\nIn addition the weather of your current location or a preconfigured fixed location is always shown. Also the time, the date in nearly any language is provided. Russian support was added lastly.
