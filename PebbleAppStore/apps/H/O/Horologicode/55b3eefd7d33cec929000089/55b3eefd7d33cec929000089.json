I kept it a little cryptic, which is the essential aesthetic of a barcode, next to the minimalistic style. I also decided to leave numbers away, that would have degraded the code to mere decoration. But you don't need numbers. \r\n\r\nAll you need to know is that the thin bar │ is a 1 and the thick bar █ is a 5.\r\nSo the thin bars count up to 4 and the thick bars up to 2, which is a 10. So a 6 for example is a thick and a thin bar. There are four sections, that are divided by a thick gap to minimize confusion, while in each section the bars are separated by thin gaps to keep a visual relationship. Left you have the hours, in the middle are 10 minute increments and on the right are the remaining minutes. On the far right is the PM indicator for relevant times. \r\n\r\nThe Pebble Time version has a gradient, giving the whole code a smoother appearance. It's not only looking cool but also goes better with the round case.\r\n\r\nDesign : Sam Jerichow Programming : Sam Jerichow\r\nCopyright © 2012, 2015 Sam Jerichow","developer_id":"54ed03c2d9c53b312f00010f","header_images":"","hearts":214,"id":"55b3eefd7d33cec929000089","latest_release":{"id":"55ba330a419198089e00003e","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/6s2LVWBjQ4e84HFwdstU","published_date":"2015-07-30T14:22:22.658Z","release_notes":"The 12th hour needed to be fixed.
