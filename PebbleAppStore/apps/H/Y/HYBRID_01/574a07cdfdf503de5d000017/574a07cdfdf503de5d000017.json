The digital time and date are easy to read at a glance, and the analog minute ring and second hand give a visual indicator of how much of the current minute and hour has elapsed. Today's step count is also displayed above the time. Automatic power savings reduce screen updates while you're asleep.\r\n\r\nThis is an early release of this watchface. More features such as temperature, customization are coming soon!\r\n\r\nDonations are welcome at: https://paypal.me/nguyer","developer_id":"52f0ef2e61b752a5520029bc","header_images":"","hearts":48,"id":"574a07cdfdf503de5d000017","latest_release":{"id":"5751e7dc28295f674e00000e","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/WYXUaG1RBu4mGfsaflAP","published_date":"2016-06-03T20:26:46.766Z","release_notes":"Battery optimizations","version":"1.2"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/574a07cdfdf503de5d000017/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/574a07cdfdf503de5d000017/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/574a07cdfdf503de5d000017/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/574a07cdfdf503de5d000017/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/574a07cdfdf503de5d000017/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/574a07cdfdf503de5d000017/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/574a07cdfdf503de5d000017"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/IY2MuyK8RxWvEitcGJjV/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/IY2MuyK8RxWvEitcGJjV/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2016-05-28T22:20:51.698Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/IY2MuyK8RxWvEitcGJjV/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/EXUbvaZ2QUWE8OWWMOAG/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"HYBRID_01","type":"watchface","uuid":"d50bff81-b731-47a3-a138-31e5b28a8255","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
