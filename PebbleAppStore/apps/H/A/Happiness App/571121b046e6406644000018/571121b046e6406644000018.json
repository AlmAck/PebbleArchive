You'll receive regular prompts that ask you to rate your mood and energy level. These prompts will occur either hourly or 4x per day, depending on your choice (during waking hours only!). They will also ask you where you are, who you're with, and what activities you've done recently. This information will help us provide you with deeper insights on how different environments and events impact your mood.\r\n\r\nDue to popular demand, the program will run for the duration of your choosing: 10 days, 30 days, or indefinitely. After every 10 days, you will receive an email report with your results through a transactional email service. Pebble will not use or share your information for any purpose beyond this app (although we may use anonymous or aggregated data to improve the app and for other internal \r\nbusiness purposes).\r\n\r\nExcept as described in this notice, the Pebble Privacy Policy covers the collection, use, sharing and protection of your information.  \r\n\r\nThis is not a marketing initiative or an attempt to fish for data -- its sole purpose is to be a fun, interesting experience for our users.  We hope you'll enjoy the app as much as we have!","developer_id":"5711208a244522d9d9000017","header_images":"","hearts":359,"icon_image":{"28x28":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/KLQCiUfpQIqtwGqD21G1/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=28&h=28","48x48":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/KLQCiUfpQIqtwGqD21G1/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=48&h=48"},"id":"571121b046e6406644000018","latest_release":{"id":"57b0e2dfbb85edbc7600040b","js_md5":"5ba3e4b1140b6faa00062d5666d278a4","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/MCQbO7DmT0G6SHAELlu3","published_date":"2016-08-14T21:30:17.071Z","release_notes":"Use pebble packages\r\nRemove background worker","version":"1.0"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/571121b046e6406644000018/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/571121b046e6406644000018/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/571121b046e6406644000018/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/571121b046e6406644000018/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/571121b046e6406644000018/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/571121b046e6406644000018/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/571121b046e6406644000018"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/6J2JSQKdQOuOw3uYBQx8/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/6J2JSQKdQOuOw3uYBQx8/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2016-06-08T17:39:40.353Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/6BpRSox4SACqqg0Z7HtY/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/4RYWdA2ES3OaA2PToCgU/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/kLcsexuhQCS4Z2bRYiPE/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/93ZkOcShQRm6XUdaAWkz/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"Happiness App","type":"watchapp","uuid":"8d1fb143-fa2a-4f1c-9361-2542f14cda72","website":"http://www.pebble.com"}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
