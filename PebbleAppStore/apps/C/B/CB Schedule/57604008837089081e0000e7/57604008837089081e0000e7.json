Unlike bears, that hibernate, this app now has gained the capability to wake up just in time for winter.\r\n\r\nThat means that in settings, there's now an option to make the app wake up every day at 12AM, to automatically fetch the date and push timeline pins. It automatically closes itself 15 seconds too! :) So instead of having to open the app every morning to have timeline pins, it will automatically do that!\r\n\r\nNOTE: This feature is disabled by default. Because of how Pebble.js apps work, this may fail if the watch isn't connected to your phone. In these cases, it will show the \"Your watch is disconnected\" message, and will not quit itself. If you see this message frequently, best to disable this option. :("},{"version":"0.40","published_date":"2016-10-14T03:30:00.067Z","release_notes":"Happy Canadian Thanksgiving (even though it was three days ago)!\r\n\r\nThis release adds timeline support for classes. As long as the app is opened at least once a day, pins will be pushed to your timeline. This means that classes can now be seen on top of the watchface (if you have a Time series or higher), or with one push of the down button!"},{"version":"0.36","published_date":"2016-09-01T23:54:07.971Z","release_notes":"The icon for Earth and Space Sciences has been changed to a rocket.
