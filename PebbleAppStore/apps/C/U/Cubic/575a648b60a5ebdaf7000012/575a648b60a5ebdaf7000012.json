Hours and minutes are represented by facets, that are arranged in two equilateral hexagons. The idea was to simulate a sort of LED illumated facets.\r\n\r\nThe outer hexagon shows the hours and the inner hexagon shows the minutes in 5-minute chunks. In the center you'll see a cube with two functions. The upper surface reprents am (off) or pm (lit) and below of this 4 single minute facets are located. With this the exact time is always available. To get closer to the idea look at the screenshots:\r\n\r\n#1 -  time lapse from 12:00 am to 12:10 am\r\n#2 -  2:42 pm (grid enabled)\r\n#3 -  9:15 am (thickest line)\r\n#4 - 11:05 am (filled)\r\n#5 - 10:22 pm (thinnest line) \r\n\r\nConfiguration allows you to setup line thickness or to choose fully lit facets. Moreover a grid can be enabled/disabled to see all facets (might be helpful in the beginning). Finally choose every possible color for the LEDs (monochrome models are bound to white).","developer_id":"56f70d3fe58879cfd4000013","header_images":"","hearts":12,"id":"575a648b60a5ebdaf7000012","latest_release":{"id":"580f65a9bbd962a39a0000d2","js_md5":"5e6f42bd0fd94c2e4cecfb31cfafa535","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/Orzf8xx7SzGaM9dIKVLG","published_date":"2016-10-25T14:01:27.486Z","release_notes":"new config, added emery","version":"1.3"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/575a648b60a5ebdaf7000012/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/575a648b60a5ebdaf7000012/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/575a648b60a5ebdaf7000012/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/575a648b60a5ebdaf7000012/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/575a648b60a5ebdaf7000012/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/575a648b60a5ebdaf7000012/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/575a648b60a5ebdaf7000012"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/mPgVUwm3SbaB0EPSsods/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/mPgVUwm3SbaB0EPSsods/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2016-06-10T09:10:59.022Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/mPgVUwm3SbaB0EPSsods/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/7Hlb7uQpS1a3su6AEtAa/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/AlQUXMXRsaEvmLjSRpLU/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/mdNnUwl6RzeWSszlu5v2/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/xJ0ZFI72QW2NgoP7g7P9/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"Cubic","type":"watchface","uuid":"6db16cd9-3f37-4eb7-866f-703d0362476d","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
