The app allows you to create 5 custom favorite stops through the settings page. The user also can find nearby bus stops. The app can refresh departure times through clicking select on the departure times page. Please note this has just been released and there are some bugs. Also I do not have a Pebble Time Watch to work with, so there may be more issues on that watch.","developer_id":"5347053c025a4e2d340000e8","header_images":[{"orig":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/R0Lqi08wTua4YwA6Macd/convert?cache=true&fit=crop","720x320":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/R0Lqi08wTua4YwA6Macd/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=720&h=320"}],"hearts":2,"icon_image":{"28x28":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/ckGnvfYtTnywz9yvUhid/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=28&h=28","48x48":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/ckGnvfYtTnywz9yvUhid/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=48&h=48"},"id":"55bbb263e6bc82c35d000055","latest_release":{"id":"55bd69c4a5c6f3d4bb00008b","js_md5":"01358466544bb89b0dc8ed58058f2d40","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/JUQa5IhxR2ai6ZY4Ic8Q","published_date":"2015-08-02T00:52:28.410Z","release_notes":"Fixed major bugs.","version":"1.1"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55bbb263e6bc82c35d000055/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55bbb263e6bc82c35d000055/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55bbb263e6bc82c35d000055/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55bbb263e6bc82c35d000055/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55bbb263e6bc82c35d000055/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55bbb263e6bc82c35d000055/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/55bbb263e6bc82c35d000055"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/BbOByefThmId9HkXt7mv/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/BbOByefThmId9HkXt7mv/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-08-02T00:52:33.519Z","screenshot_hardware":"aplite","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/QGSIoYUBShC6gYcToCUH/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/sIrDE9L5T0KcCTheIQs5/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/VWO8KruQTaXFZvyQWw8A/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"https://github.com/lezzago/PebbleCUMTD","title":"CUMTD","type":"watchapp","uuid":"0e2309f1-0773-4c0d-b23e-dfeab2be8477","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
