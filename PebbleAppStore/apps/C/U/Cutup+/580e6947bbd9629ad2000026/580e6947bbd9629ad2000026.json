While the watchface can be configured to show the date when shaking the watch, that is not the most reliable way to show information and there may be more data of interest. To remedy this I have created Cut/up+ to show additional data.\r\n\r\nYou can tie Cut/up+ to a quick launch button and configure it to look exactly like the watchface. If you press the quick launch you will get a short glimpse of the data you selected and then return to the watchface.\r\n\r\nOf course the watchapp can also be used without Cut/up if you have another watchface that is missing some data you want to see at the quick press of a button.\r\n\r\n* Available data to chose from\r\n  - Day of the month\r\n  - Month\r\n  - Year\r\n  - Battery level\r\n  - Calendar week\r\n  - Day of the week\r\n\r\n* All colors are fully customizable (backgrounds, number colors, number borders, cutting line and cutting line borders).\r\n\r\n* The cutting line doubles as a Bluetooth connection status indicator.\r\n\r\n* The numbers can be moved up and down to further individualize the design.\r\n\r\n* Animations can be disabled.\r\n\r\n* Leading zeroes can be hidden.\r\n\r\n* The current weekday and date is show as an AppGlance.\r\n\r\nThe font is called \"Peace Sans\", designed by Sergey Ryadovoy.\r\n\r\nPlease remember to give the Watchapp a \"heart\" if you like it.
