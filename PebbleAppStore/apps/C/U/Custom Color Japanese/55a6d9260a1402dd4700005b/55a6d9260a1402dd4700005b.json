This is the watch-face for you.\r\nFeatures 11 characters.\r\n\r\nWhy it's interesting:\r\nThe Japanese number system is similar to the Latin in that it is in base 10, the symbols themselves are different and 10 is represented by 1 character.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n10 = 十\r\n40 = 四十\r\n15 = 十五\r\n45 = 四五\r\n\r\nThis watch-face is based off big time so it is read left -> right, top -> bottom.\r\nIf you want to change this to be the traditional orientation, you can do so on the configuration webpage.","developer_id":"53d6061911a2f84fcc0001b0","header_images":"","hearts":15,"id":"55a6d9260a1402dd4700005b","latest_release":{"id":"55e2300d0939718c0c000094","js_md5":"b39c8a22c5ef0942006273fca740a1fe","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/6epZZIRPSR6sl2T9eYWI","published_date":"2015-08-29T22:21:14.941Z","release_notes":"New font","version":"1.96"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55a6d9260a1402dd4700005b/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55a6d9260a1402dd4700005b/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55a6d9260a1402dd4700005b/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55a6d9260a1402dd4700005b/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55a6d9260a1402dd4700005b/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55a6d9260a1402dd4700005b/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/55a6d9260a1402dd4700005b"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/35G6tjJQxiCXPW7fM9rR/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/35G6tjJQxiCXPW7fM9rR/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-07-15T22:24:50.787Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/35G6tjJQxiCXPW7fM9rR/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"Custom Color Japanese","type":"watchface","uuid":"23c842cb-a466-4f8e-bed3-ee616ed16e64","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
