Outer ring for hours, next ring in for 10-minutes, middle for single minutes.  The code is mostly derived from rainbow colors “Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet” (red starting at 1).  0 is light green, 8 light gray, 9 light blue and, for 10-hours, the 1 is dark blue.  \r\n\r\n“Up-down” mode - \"up\" for hours, \"down\" for minutes - left for 10-minutes, right for single minutes.  Same color code used.\r\n\r\n\"Count\" mode - count dark gray blocks in the 4 quadrants.\r\n\r\nA cheat option is activated by shaking the watch: shows digits in text - helpful when learning.   Shake again to make it disappear.   Can be disabled in settings.\r\n\r\nAn animation every 15 minutes can also be disabled.\r\n\r\nFirst screenshot animation shows the transition from 03:14 to 03:15 in \"Cyclops\" mode.\r\n\r\nOther screenshots:  \r\n(2)   7:13  \"Cyclops\" mode (cheat display)\r\n(3)   7:13  \"Up-Down\" mode\r\n(4)   7:14  \"Count\" mode\r\n(5) 12:47  \"Cyclops\" mode\r\n\r\nDesign created by Dietrich Faust and originally appeared on the Tokyoflash Design Studio.
