This watch loses or gains several minutes a day, depending on how much it's been wound, where winding is accomplished by switching out and back into the face.  Additionally, it believes that every month has 31 days.  You reset to the correct time and date by fully winding the watch.\r\n(Note that this face is a very slight modification of the \"simple_analog\" face from the Pebble SDK examples.)","developer_id":"5491f686b7c25336ba00001f","hearts":2,"id":"54a708610cd93626c90000da","latest_release":{"id":"54a70a252daaa4302a0000dc","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/JopkjEHHQuqqwWRgvcR5","published_date":"2015-01-02T21:14:38.734Z","release_notes":"","version":"1.0"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54a708610cd93626c90000da/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54a708610cd93626c90000da/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54a708610cd93626c90000da/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54a708610cd93626c90000da/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54a708610cd93626c90000da/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54a708610cd93626c90000da/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/54a708610cd93626c90000da"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/3QChjVM6RNqjxEXBpthg/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/3QChjVM6RNqjxEXBpthg/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-01-02T21:20:29.729Z","screenshot_hardware":"aplite","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/3QChjVM6RNqjxEXBpthg/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"https://github.com/pnf/pebble-sdk-examples/tree/master/watchfaces/crappy_analog","title":"Clunky Old Watch","type":"watchface","uuid":"6e3badb3-60d0-4ea7-a933-594a69d624f3","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
