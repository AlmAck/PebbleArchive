Background art is simple yet original. I made the background myself spending a surprising amount of time trying to get it to be perfect. The font however is not by me. It is called drawing with markers and i got it off of the website dafont.com. Please enjoy this watch-face.","developer_id":"549c2a22dc93036be50003c2","hearts":7,"id":"54a76a0b2a5f3df827000150","latest_release":{"id":"54a822cbce2fb751a60000a6","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/7R93qZTNTVaYgdx7Vg3p","published_date":"2015-01-03T17:13:26.419Z","release_notes":"first release of watchface.","version":"1.0"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54a76a0b2a5f3df827000150/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54a76a0b2a5f3df827000150/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54a76a0b2a5f3df827000150/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54a76a0b2a5f3df827000150/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54a76a0b2a5f3df827000150/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54a76a0b2a5f3df827000150/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/54a76a0b2a5f3df827000150"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/V8DlsCFEQY2Jytg4fC5I/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/V8DlsCFEQY2Jytg4fC5I/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-01-03T17:13:32.323Z","screenshot_hardware":"aplite","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/V8DlsCFEQY2Jytg4fC5I/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"Crossed","type":"watchface","uuid":"45e1ec9d-b083-4538-8269-4e2c4a34158d","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
