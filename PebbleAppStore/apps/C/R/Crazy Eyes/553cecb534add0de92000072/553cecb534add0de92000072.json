The left eye represents the hour, the right eye the current minute. In the first screenshot it is 19:31 (7:31 pm). \r\n\r\nNEW: Background color configurable\r\nNEW: Easter egg for Halloween.\r\nNEW: Googly Eyes! Try it out by enabling it in the settings.\r\nNEW: Nightstand mode when on charger (optional)\r\n\r\nThe eyebrows are configurable and encode the battery level of your pebble from 100% in the first screenshot to 10% in the second one. On a bluetooth disconnect, the eyebrows become narrower.\r\n\r\nOptionally, the face can be completed with a mouth that shows the day of the month in binary.\r\n\r\nPlease support the further development of this watchface by purchasing it for 1.50 USD after a trial period of 48 hours. Payment will by handled by KiezelPay.If you donated to me in the past, shoot me a mail and I'll give you a 100% off!","developer_id":"52d29655c44c044e9f00004f","header_images":"","hearts":615,"id":"553cecb534add0de92000072","latest_release":{"id":"5833211800355a3b510001b8","js_md5":"9a71e25553a8794a1dab7abf94b04900","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/TFsTP8MTR0u0nbbE81UM","published_date":"2016-11-21T16:31:50.685Z","release_notes":"- Re-added random background color option","version":"3.2"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/553cecb534add0de92000072/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/553cecb534add0de92000072/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/553cecb534add0de92000072/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/553cecb534add0de92000072/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/553cecb534add0de92000072/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/553cecb534add0de92000072/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/553cecb534add0de92000072"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/d6FJ7OtRRhip61Wgpekr/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/d6FJ7OtRRhip61Wgpekr/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-04-26T13:51:40.275Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/d6FJ7OtRRhip61Wgpekr/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/2DHo9C3aQ9yN8bocz2A9/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/TPDfwZCwQ4eLy8dq0lq4/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/DmZUOg3ETbaPUjGXmafw/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/amlDUE7ERsCsxdMMvA21/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"Crazy Eyes","type":"watchface","uuid":"c044c365-a5f0-4316-9208-1130d7a2c1e7","website":"http://reini1305.github.io/"}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
