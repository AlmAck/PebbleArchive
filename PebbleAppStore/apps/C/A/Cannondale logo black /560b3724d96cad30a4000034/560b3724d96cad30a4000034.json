The train station 1971. Cannondale bicycles are made in Pennsylvania USA. There are only a couple models still totally produced by hand due to cost. Most of the lower end frames have been outsourced to China. I own an all USA made one I made it in both black and white, they are both posted here.  I chose a digital format and the date is offset so I get it all on there. Just remembering the original.
