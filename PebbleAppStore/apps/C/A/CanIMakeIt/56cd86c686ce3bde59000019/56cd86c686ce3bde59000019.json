This is a tool for you. CanIMakeIt shows you the distance to your destination and base on your current to calculate when you will be there. But remember this use a very simple algorithm to calculate, don't relay on this, judge by yourself.\r\n\r\nHow to use:\r\nYou need to be the location you want to go to, for example, the train station you normally commute to. Mark your current position as you destination. At the moment, this is the only way to set your destination. Next time, when you want to travel to this station(destination), you can just select the location you that you mark in this watch app. What you will see is the distance to your destination, and the estimate arrival time base on your current speed. Note: the speed and estimate arrival time is calculated with a very simple algorithm. It's for your reference only. \r\n\r\nHow this works (algorithm)\r\nBased on three points. Start point, the position you lunch this app. Current, the position getting from GPS. Destination, the marked position. \r\nYour speed = distance of start to current / time\r\nEstimated Arrival Time = distance to destination / Your speed\r\nNote: Just this simple, it assume you are directly heading to your destination, so it's not accurate at all.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n* Get the address of current position.\r\n* Calculate the time to destination. \r\n* Option to turn off enableHighAccuracy, can be used to save battery.\r\n* Vibrate when ETA changed\r\nShows GPS accuracy","developer_id":"5553ace1dd51ad193d000060","header_images":"","hearts":6,"icon_image":{"28x28":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/MTZBT4frQ1WwqoRLgbgl/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=28&h=28","48x48":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/MTZBT4frQ1WwqoRLgbgl/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=48&h=48"},"id":"56cd86c686ce3bde59000019","latest_release":{"id":"56d0a8d31c43fb10bd000044","js_md5":"15d8061dc109e2ddf76a9e7f8d2d4e35","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/cp3Ue0VDTF631Pfsez09","published_date":"2016-02-26T19:35:28.091Z","release_notes":"Show visual indicator in navigation view.","version":"1.2"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56cd86c686ce3bde59000019/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56cd86c686ce3bde59000019/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56cd86c686ce3bde59000019/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56cd86c686ce3bde59000019/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56cd86c686ce3bde59000019/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56cd86c686ce3bde59000019/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/56cd86c686ce3bde59000019"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/c9aRLD6iSnmGH6wdAEvV/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/c9aRLD6iSnmGH6wdAEvV/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2016-02-24T10:51:26.023Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/DiEWmkdUQYS4Ma5UxMGa/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/KEIQw3UQmakNSfHnTsDw/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"https://github.com/cmwen/CanIMakeIt","title":"CanIMakeIt","type":"watchapp","uuid":"7f23a187-4dd6-4299-9578-81073361b4fc","website":"https://github.com/cmwen/CanIMakeIt"}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
