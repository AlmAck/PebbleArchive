This is how the two columns of lights were made. Please check the number explanation in the preview section!\r\n\r\nAt first those light columns are seen as single information units but the way to read the watch is across the center gap which nobody will know when you show them the display. \r\n\r\nI let the lights seem to originate from the lateral display edges, getting stronger on the and then suddenly stop. This bilateral design reminded me of a capacitor, and so the name was born. \r\n\r\nThe Capacitor watch face is for fans of science fiction as well as science fact. \r\n\r\nDesign / Programming / Copyright Â© 2014, 2015 Sam Jerichow","developer_id":"54ed03c2d9c53b312f00010f","header_images":"","hearts":34,"id":"55942375327b5a289100005c","latest_release":{"id":"5594366557dd91345200006f","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/TgxBC96ORtGyMAs9xbZR","published_date":"2015-07-10T19:39:12.823Z","release_notes":"","version":"1.0"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55942375327b5a289100005c/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55942375327b5a289100005c/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55942375327b5a289100005c/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55942375327b5a289100005c/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55942375327b5a289100005c/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55942375327b5a289100005c/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/55942375327b5a289100005c"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/XazVli5zQ1OSM9BT7GaF/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/XazVli5zQ1OSM9BT7GaF/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-07-10T19:39:40.967Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/XazVli5zQ1OSM9BT7GaF/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/OWp9luEAS1iOKmvTUpLH/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/9JWm7WuxQganPDLQjIlJ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/iQe6M2SdeL33hpag7epg/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/VVYUUyNKSgOxPWtZNC5y/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"Capacitor R","type":"watchface","uuid":"69900b23-7921-4be3-88e5-cc928e39f4de","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
