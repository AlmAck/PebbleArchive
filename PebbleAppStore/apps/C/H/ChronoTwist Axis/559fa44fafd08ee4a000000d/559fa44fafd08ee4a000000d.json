Twist the watch so that it is facing away from you (~90 degrees from where you started) until you feel a brief vibration. When you are ready to start the chronograph, twist the watch back to the starting position (facing up) until you feel another brief vibration. At this point the chronograph and tachymeter will appear. \r\n\r\nTo stop the chronograph, repeat the previous steps and the time will turn red to indicate the chronograph is stopped. The chronograph can be restarted using the same actions. \r\n\r\nTo reset the chronograph, hold the watch facing up until the twist symbol appears. Twist the watch so that it is facing away from you (~90 degrees from where you started) until you feel a brief vibration. Next twist the watch so that it is facing directly downward (~180 degrees from where you started) until you feel a brief vibration. \r\n\r\nCredits: merred's taller, loved the 90 degree text dividing the hour and minute. \r\n","developer_id":"52dbe87d9ffd8701d5000071","header_images":"","hearts":43,"id":"559fa44fafd08ee4a000000d","latest_release":{"id":"56b7aef345c6f9c3ed000028","js_md5":"a487f2459bf75729f5660ac0a5db40cb","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/bfM28XZ5SziRAXw2LfhA","published_date":"2016-02-07T20:54:39.340Z","release_notes":"Uses Pebble Health API for step counting (and removed timeline integration)\r\nLighter color for hour and minute fonts","version":"3.0"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/559fa44fafd08ee4a000000d/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/559fa44fafd08ee4a000000d/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/559fa44fafd08ee4a000000d/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/559fa44fafd08ee4a000000d/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/559fa44fafd08ee4a000000d/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/559fa44fafd08ee4a000000d/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/559fa44fafd08ee4a000000d"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/A7L8pQrcSQucGm1u39oP/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/A7L8pQrcSQucGm1u39oP/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-07-19T12:22:37.745Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/A7L8pQrcSQucGm1u39oP/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/GoTrOHozRJOXwY1EJ5vH/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/s4p94IAvReWyo5ryv1LN/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"ChronoTwist Axis","type":"watchface","uuid":"7fe4de6c-6d51-4098-a305-7761a2f0a462","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
