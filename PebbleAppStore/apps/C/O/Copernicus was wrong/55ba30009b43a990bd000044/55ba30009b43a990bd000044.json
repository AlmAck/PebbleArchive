Then he would have proof that the sun & moon orbit the Earth. In this watchface, the sun represents the minute hand, the moon the hour hand. Both have little animations every minute when their position changes. Also, every 5 minutes, we have some aliens whizzing by.\r\n\r\nThe app has 2 configuration items : in one, you can switch the position of sun & moon as hour/minute dial.  In the second, you can opt for the ISS and the moon orbiting the earth.","developer_id":"52fbe67755fbc6064e000688","header_images":"","hearts":42,"id":"55ba30009b43a990bd000044","latest_release":{"id":"55cfa765b78473aa1500004f","js_md5":"8fb5a5cbf63d4d6034fa8142faa29695","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/xcnWh65cRcmQlOZtr5KQ","published_date":"2015-08-15T20:56:18.325Z","release_notes":"Version 2.4 :\r\n- Slower UFO movement in order to comply with Einstein's relativity theory ;)","version":"2.4"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55ba30009b43a990bd000044/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55ba30009b43a990bd000044/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55ba30009b43a990bd000044/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55ba30009b43a990bd000044/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55ba30009b43a990bd000044/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55ba30009b43a990bd000044/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/55ba30009b43a990bd000044"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/LzNgXI9Rem56q8CUSdRR/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/LzNgXI9Rem56q8CUSdRR/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-07-31T09:21:04.436Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/LzNgXI9Rem56q8CUSdRR/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/jbA1yvZRvOXNvDPZiuFD/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"Copernicus was wrong","type":"watchface","uuid":"7739c113-8af4-4e50-8bad-a6dc58f139c1","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
