This is the last update for content that was part of my original vision for this app. Two new options, based on less interaction between nations, but on your own nation. \"Produce Nukes\": Increase your power, but at what risk? \"Push Research\": Assemble a research team to develop new technologies, just make sure that none of your researchers are spies. The instructions screen is also improved, so that it's aesthetically better and it also shows automatically the first time the app is run. It can also now be closed with the select button. Enjoy what is probably the final content release!"},{"version":"1.2","published_date":"2015-04-19T00:35:43.729Z","release_notes":"Added turn counter, turn history, and options"},{"version":"1.1","published_date":"2015-03-18T05:28:48.028Z","release_notes":"Huzzah!

The fate of the world is in your hands as you use strategy and wits to either defeat them by force or by persuading them to demilitarize. Fight proxy wars, send spies, make pleas to cut down on the nukes, and more in this thrilling new game. Now with colours for Pebble Time.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: This is a tongue-in-cheek satirical parody of both the cold war and of modern â€œsimulator\" games.
