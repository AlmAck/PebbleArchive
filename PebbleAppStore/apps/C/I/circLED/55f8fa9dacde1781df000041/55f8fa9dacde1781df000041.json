Seconds are not shown as numbers but as a thin circular arc just inside the edge of the white circle, updating each second. The seconds also show for 30sec on launch.\r\n\r\nWhile not showing seconds, the watchface is in 'minute' mode to save a bit of battery.\r\n\r\nCurrent battery charge is displayed in the smaller circle, lower right corner.  On a pebble time the circle fill is colour, else it's just white.\r\n\r\nThe bluetooth symbol disappears when bluetooth is not connected.\r\n\r\nsept 20: enabled 24h zero","developer_id":"52d76309bd61272345000001","header_images":"","hearts":44,"id":"55f8fa9dacde1781df000041","latest_release":{"id":"55f8fb5d75eb49c5c900003a","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/cf1wCM8yRWaXEgu46p4V","published_date":"2015-09-16T05:17:43.748Z","release_notes":"","version":"1.0"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55f8fa9dacde1781df000041/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55f8fa9dacde1781df000041/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55f8fa9dacde1781df000041/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55f8fa9dacde1781df000041/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55f8fa9dacde1781df000041/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55f8fa9dacde1781df000041/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/55f8fa9dacde1781df000041"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/JUJJcuGQ36BCnvYT9ML1/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/JUJJcuGQ36BCnvYT9ML1/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-09-16T05:17:51.013Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/JUJJcuGQ36BCnvYT9ML1/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/kooQNwvSTxq1Euv9wCJB/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"https://github.com/mereed/pebbleface-circled","title":"circLED","type":"watchface","uuid":"66f1fa22-c57d-47f8-9147-97dfc7a1b081","website":"http://www.markspebblefaces.com/marks/circled/"}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
