They are somewhat curved digits, to give a more abstract feel to the display.  \r\n\r\nThe top left and top right are the hours, and bottom left and bottom right are the minutes.\r\n\r\nThe original design had LEDs in the relevant positions that were used in different combinations to give the numbers – this resulted in different sizes for the different numbers.  These same forms have been kept here, so some numbers are larger than others – this adds to the very different look.\r\n\r\nThe screenshot examples show:  \r\n (1) 23:44\r\n (2) 09:38\r\n (3) 05:56\r\n (4) 16:47\r\n (5) 21:52\r\n\r\nThis watchface is published with the designers’ permission, and sanctioned by Tokyoflash.   \r\n\r\nThe original design can be found here:  \r\nhttp://blog.tokyoflash.com/2012/12/31/kizamu-led-watch-takes-the-edge-off/\r\n\r\nTo see other sanctioned Tokyoflash watchfaces, click on \"More from this Developer\".","developer_id":"54547c1fe77c14d0a1000033","hearts":6,"id":"54f60712adc8648842000075","latest_release":{"id":"54fc416aea06cc203900000c","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/ZdzjIN9vQpqnRXj0htko","published_date":"2015-03-08T12:32:57.191Z","release_notes":"Removed diagnostic code","version":"1.1"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54f60712adc8648842000075/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54f60712adc8648842000075/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54f60712adc8648842000075/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54f60712adc8648842000075/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54f60712adc8648842000075/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54f60712adc8648842000075/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/54f60712adc8648842000075"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/LnrPYT6ZStCDc76ZlOm4/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/LnrPYT6ZStCDc76ZlOm4/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-03-03T19:12:15.718Z","screenshot_hardware":"aplite","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/LnrPYT6ZStCDc76ZlOm4/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/iGavxzKnT4uYM9TwUuzX/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/5OvadbYITTO7BZMu2wc9/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/iIy918alRlioWzySyy30/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/ZUpHVIqTjme0mKX64yAC/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"Kizamu","type":"watchface","uuid":"53bc1390-550b-4ab4-a9f3-6405a2f9f61a","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
