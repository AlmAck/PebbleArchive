You can receive your friends'positions and display them with your own track, directly on your Pebble.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n* GPS cycle computer (instant speed, average speed, distance, altitude, positive ascent, ascent rate, slope)\r\n* If available, use pressure sensor to improve altitude accuracy (Galaxy S3+, Nexus 4+...)\r\n* Tracks can be saved as GPX and exported to compatible services (Strava, Runkeeper...)\r\n* Multiple units (metric, imperial, nautical, pace...)\r\n* Bluetooth Smart (BLE) Heart Rate Monitor (classic bluetooth HRM are not supported) and Cycling Speed and Cadence (CSC)\r\n* Watchapp in english, german, spanish and french\r\n* Customizable screens with built-in configuration or with Canvas plugin\r\n* OruxMaps integration\r\n\r\nThis app has no affiliation with the Swiss rights holder named Ventoo GmbH.","developer_id":"528d06f11fdcc0ebd7000006","header_images":[{"orig":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/M0C8lVn0QXNTivCVgM2A/convert?cache=true&fit=crop","720x320":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/M0C8lVn0QXNTivCVgM2A/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=720&h=320"},{"orig":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/bkFVT7mT4qfxBZ1156qg/convert?cache=true&fit=crop","720x320":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/bkFVT7mT4qfxBZ1156qg/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=720&h=320"},{"orig":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/EEWixfzuRrKPhsH0gfFH/convert?cache=true&fit=crop","720x320":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/EEWixfzuRrKPhsH0gfFH/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=720&h=320"}],"hearts":853,"icon_image":{"28x28":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/Bp6VbsIIQSWCW6ctmy1L/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=28&h=28","48x48":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/Bp6VbsIIQSWCW6ctmy1L/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=48&h=48"},"id":"529289cee07df1fa76000009","latest_release":{"id":"57e36b2c87d6bb27300000f1","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/YsWeUvIiReWkLh1Sj7IO","published_date":"2016-09-22T05:25:39.840Z","release_notes":"WHAT'S NEW v2.9.1\r\n * [Pebble 2] Add support for Pebble 2 and built-in heart rate monitor\r\n * [Pebble classic] Add more functions thanks to advanced memory optimizations (Overlays, thanks gregoiresage)\r\n * [Firmware 4] Add App Glance : displays distance and ascent in the Pebble app menu","version":"2.91"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/529289cee07df1fa76000009/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/529289cee07df1fa76000009/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/529289cee07df1fa76000009/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/529289cee07df1fa76000009/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/529289cee07df1fa76000009/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/529289cee07df1fa76000009/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/529289cee07df1fa76000009"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/T4brLBsYSdqXxI70YVBq/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/T4brLBsYSdqXxI70YVBq/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2014-06-03T06:08:22.220Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/A4uE0IzRg2XKYccx346w/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/ve0yofutTtCcy6jGP6n1/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/iyzxis8sS9KhRlQ0pTXN/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/zHz5OfyQCSSrFo946Opq/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"https://github.com/pebble-bike/PebbleBike-AndroidApp","title":"Ventoo - GPS sports tracker","type":"watchapp","uuid":"5dd35873-3bb6-44d6-8255-0e61bc3b97f5","website":"http://www.pebblebike.com/"}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
