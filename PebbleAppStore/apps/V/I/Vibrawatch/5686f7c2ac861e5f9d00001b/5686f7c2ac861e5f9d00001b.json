That's it.  It is designed to aid the blind or visually impaired - for whom specialist watches can be quite expensive and even then don't have the additional capabilities of smartwatches (eg, fitness tracking). \r\n\r\nVibrawatch works in two ways:\r\nFirstly, the watch uses as large a time display as will fit on the watch.  To do this we've split the hours and minutes display - every 10 seconds you get 3 seconds of the hour, and 7 seconds of the minute displayed.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the two (or more) flicks of the wrist will set of the vibration system.  This encodes the time using vibrating pulses - a long pulse for 5 and short pulses for 1s, with gaps between the hours, tens of minutes and minute vibrations.  If the digit is a zero then the system sets of a longer modulated vibration.  Sounds complicated, but you get the hang of it fairly quickly!\r\n\r\nIn addition, the watch-face has a thick horizontal bar below the hours display - this serves as indication that the face is displaying hours and also shows the battery level.\r\n\r\nDolaugu Ltd is an R&D company based in Berkshire, UK, with a section dedicated to solutions for those fully capable of living alone, but who need that little extra help (eg, see www.notcheckingup.com).  Vibrawatch was developed over Christmas 2015 as an internal training project, and released when we realised it was actually quite useful!\r\n","developer_id":"567d69f50bdc46ca6d000192","header_images":"","hearts":15,"id":"5686f7c2ac861e5f9d00001b","latest_release":{"id":"568705a1ac861e8e90000029","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/75oLCzH7Thi2HSUVJzFX","published_date":"2016-01-01T23:05:13.751Z","release_notes":"Initial commit","version":"1.0"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5686f7c2ac861e5f9d00001b/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5686f7c2ac861e5f9d00001b/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5686f7c2ac861e5f9d00001b/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5686f7c2ac861e5f9d00001b/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5686f7c2ac861e5f9d00001b/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5686f7c2ac861e5f9d00001b/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/5686f7c2ac861e5f9d00001b"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/CIa9jVfsT1mtu3TpSuWJ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/CIa9jVfsT1mtu3TpSuWJ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2016-01-01T23:51:36.751Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/CIa9jVfsT1mtu3TpSuWJ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"Vibrawatch","type":"watchface","uuid":"04c5903c-0fa9-4be9-93ac-18f6130af590","website":"http://www.dolaugu.com"}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
