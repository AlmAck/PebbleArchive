For example, you could set Vibe Time as one of your quick launch entries.  That button then will send the vibes but immediately return you to the watch face.\r\n\r\nTimes are sent as three groups of vibrations.  The first is for the hour on a 12 hour clock.  The second is the tens digit of the minute.  The third is for the ones digit of the minute.\r\n\r\nEach vibe group uses as tally system.  A short vibe is one.  A long vibe is three.  Zero is represented with four short vibes.  The codes are thus a follows:\r\n\r\n0 => sort short short shot\r\n1 => short\r\n2 => short\r\n3 => long\r\n4 => long short\r\n5 => long short short\r\n6 => long long\r\n7 => long long short\r\n8 => long long short short\r\n9 => long long long\r\n10 => long long long short\r\n11 => long long long short short\r\n12 => long long long long\r\n","developer_id":"5356397a230640ce89000112","header_images":"","hearts":10,"icon_image":{"28x28":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/ca7FYs1Q16at5uU9BlBE/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=28&h=28","48x48":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/ca7FYs1Q16at5uU9BlBE/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=48&h=48"},"id":"569e992eeeede1484900003e","latest_release":{"id":"569e9a40c7fdf71b9d00005f","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/cWyHVf6SDGSiphvZPFE6","published_date":"2016-01-21T15:58:42.744Z","release_notes":"","version":"1.0"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/569e992eeeede1484900003e/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/569e992eeeede1484900003e/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/569e992eeeede1484900003e/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/569e992eeeede1484900003e/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/569e992eeeede1484900003e/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/569e992eeeede1484900003e/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/569e992eeeede1484900003e"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/B0l2xusnQMWAFQQVNO0m/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/B0l2xusnQMWAFQQVNO0m/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2016-01-21T20:39:15.099Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/UykckpYxQ8aH6VkQoUkX/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"https://bitbucket.org/adamsmd/vibe-time","title":"Vibe Time","type":"watchapp","uuid":"221d2fe5-6198-4424-b8e7-2998509bc7fd","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
