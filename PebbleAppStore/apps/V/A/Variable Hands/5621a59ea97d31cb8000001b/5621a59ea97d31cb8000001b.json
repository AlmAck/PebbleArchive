In the case of the minute and second hands, they reach all the way to the edge.  The hour hand grows and shrinks to keep a constant 35 pixels from the edge of the screen.\r\n\r\nThere are several configuration options:\r\n- Whether or not the second hand is drawn.\r\n- Start and end hours for the second hand to be drawn.\r\n- Colors for the second hand.\r\n- Whether a battery status indicator is drawn.\r\n- Whether a date window is drawn.\r\n- Whether the digital time is drawn.\r\n- Colors of the day/digital time windows.\r\n- Dark and light themes.\r\n\r\nI will also be looking at options to keep the date window from being obstructed by the minute and hour hands.","developer_id":"52b50553d384d88d6200000b","header_images":"","hearts":38,"id":"5621a59ea97d31cb8000001b","latest_release":{"id":"5629142d6b9019da7900006f","js_md5":"921a649e2be10fc1ff5a3077dea6f443","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/DOkfGtw4QRWao6PFYtvG","published_date":"2015-10-22T16:52:12.645Z","release_notes":"I think I uploaded a bad binary on the 1.7 release.
