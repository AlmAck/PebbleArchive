The 6th dot is selected indicating that it's June.\r\n\r\nAt the bottom left are 5 dots to indicate battery level.\r\n\r\nAt the bottom right are 7 dots to indicate the week with the first and last dot being red to indicate Sunday and Saturday respectively. For example, if the 2nd dot is bold, it indicates Monday.\r\n\r\nYou can change the first dot to be Sunday or Monday in settings.\r\n\r\nThe second hand is hidden by default to maximize battery life, but you can turn it on in settings.\r\n\r\nCustomize the colors in settings.\r\n\r\nWhen bluetooth is disconnected, the watch vibrates and shows a bluetooth icon.\r\n\r\nHourly vibrate is set to go off once at noon, but you can set a time range in settings. The vibrate pattern follows the Roman numerals:\r\n\r\n3 o'clock = III = short+short+short\r\n6 o'clock = VI = long+short\r\n9 o'clock = IX = IVV = short+long+long\r\n12 o'clock = XII = VVII = long+long+short+short\r\n\r\nThe hourly vibrate is late by 10 seconds to avoid overlapping with vibrations from calendar events.","developer_id":"547a03513f44377417000034","header_images":"","hearts":569,"id":"55879d813ae5e5d6d50000c4","latest_release":{"id":"5645b4f31372a654aa00004a","js_md5":"9d05770708f7c2914ae8e5e544f6d7c8","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/IgEdEiYmRPmkglGw0Ue1","published_date":"2015-11-13T10:03:24.850Z","release_notes":"Support for Pebble Time Round","version":"1.5"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55879d813ae5e5d6d50000c4/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55879d813ae5e5d6d50000c4/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55879d813ae5e5d6d50000c4/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55879d813ae5e5d6d50000c4/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55879d813ae5e5d6d50000c4/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55879d813ae5e5d6d50000c4/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/55879d813ae5e5d6d50000c4"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/IaOKog8oRCqfQ2Ng4pIG/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/IaOKog8oRCqfQ2Ng4pIG/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-06-22T05:52:33.142Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/IaOKog8oRCqfQ2Ng4pIG/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/bS4o7j0ERU6w7xRChZcZ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/fInxzKVmR4qcWjw4LEee/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"Voyager","type":"watchface","uuid":"415f7861-3c7c-4d7e-b413-fb965b94e5e6","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
