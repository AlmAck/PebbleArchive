The first row displays the hour, the second displays the first digit of the minute, and the third displays the right digit of the minute (all in binary). The bottom left and right corners display symbols representing AM or PM (* for AM and - for PM). As binary watchfaces go, this format is fairly quick to read, so you can look nerdy and tell the time simultaneously. This version also shows the month, weekday, and day of the month (4 bits, 4 bits, and 5 bits). Month is displayed on the left, weekday on the right, and day of the month on the bottom.","developer_id":"549c942145afee81060008e4","header_images":"","hearts":11,"id":"566a2c655ab6bdf41200006d","latest_release":{"id":"567cd58458ad4c72e0000105","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/X4pVDSJPS2ms1FFa57YF","published_date":"2015-12-25T05:36:53.225Z","release_notes":"Updated to SDK 3","version":"1.2"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/566a2c655ab6bdf41200006d/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/566a2c655ab6bdf41200006d/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/566a2c655ab6bdf41200006d/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/566a2c655ab6bdf41200006d/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/566a2c655ab6bdf41200006d/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/566a2c655ab6bdf41200006d/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/566a2c655ab6bdf41200006d"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/9ywvDX42RbyM0ZQ8jyHh/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/9ywvDX42RbyM0ZQ8jyHh/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-12-11T02:04:32.079Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/9ywvDX42RbyM0ZQ8jyHh/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"12-5-9 Enhanced Binary Watchface","type":"watchface","uuid":"5c63291d-b771-4500-adea-7b0b4f58f82c","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
