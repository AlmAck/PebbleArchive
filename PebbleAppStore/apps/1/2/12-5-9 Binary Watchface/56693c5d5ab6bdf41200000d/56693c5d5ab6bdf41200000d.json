The first row displays the hour, the second displays the first digit of the minute, and the third displays the right digit of the minute (all in binary). The sides display symbols representing AM or PM (* for AM and | for PM). As binary watchfaces go, this format is fairly quick to read, so you can look nerdy and tell the time simultaneously. Note: This is the first thing I've done on pebble, so if you have any comments, complaints, or suggestions, please let me know!","developer_id":"549c942145afee81060008e4","header_images":"","hearts":8,"id":"56693c5d5ab6bdf41200000d","latest_release":{"id":"56a6a2f4481c67b86f000065","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/Lq6fTve9RaGQV79yNv7h","published_date":"2016-01-25T22:37:15.201Z","release_notes":"Released for Pebble Time","version":"1.4"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56693c5d5ab6bdf41200000d/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56693c5d5ab6bdf41200000d/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56693c5d5ab6bdf41200000d/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56693c5d5ab6bdf41200000d/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56693c5d5ab6bdf41200000d/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56693c5d5ab6bdf41200000d/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/56693c5d5ab6bdf41200000d"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/cCbc4uWyS7WC3QxEX5L2/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/cCbc4uWyS7WC3QxEX5L2/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-12-10T08:59:42.622Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/cCbc4uWyS7WC3QxEX5L2/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"12-5-9 Binary Watchface","type":"watchface","uuid":"6dbfc2be-91e1-4c3a-96b8-4661e528a527","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
