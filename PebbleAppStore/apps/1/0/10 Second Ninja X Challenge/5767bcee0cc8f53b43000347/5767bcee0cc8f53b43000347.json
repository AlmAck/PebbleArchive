Players assume control of a highly nimble and deadly ninja, tasked with destroying an army of hostile robots using cunning, speed and lots and lots of throwing stars.\r\n\r\nDon’t let the title seduce you too much – reaching the end of the game won’t be easy. The game’s smartly designed to ensure that each level is a puzzle in itself. With just 10 seconds (maximum) to destroy all enemies, players will need to combine brain with throwing stars in order to meet each level’s objectives, with lightning-fast reactions required to be rewarded with a perfect score.\r\n\r\n10 Second Ninja X boasts 100 immaculately designed levels. Whilst much of the challenge comes from demonstrating the dexterity and reactions necessary to traverse each level – players with real skill will want to complete each quickly. \r\n\r\nIt’s out now on PC, Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and Vita.\r\nwww.10second.ninja\r\n\r\n \r\nInstructions: \r\n\r\nShake wrist to start timer\r\nShake wrist to stop. \r\n\r\nUp button - about the game\r\nMiddle button - retrieve prize if you've won it already\r\nDown button - further information","developer_id":"52ae3d0b935fa8ddcc00001e","header_images":[{"orig":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/1vus2E53RrG9I8b7u8Rh/convert?cache=true&fit=crop","720x320":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/1vus2E53RrG9I8b7u8Rh/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=720&h=320"}],"hearts":22,"icon_image":{"28x28":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/iH0hj3goRse1cikeHJPl/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=28&h=28","48x48":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/iH0hj3goRse1cikeHJPl/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=48&h=48"},"id":"5767bcee0cc8f53b43000347","latest_release":{"id":"578b27ff84accc5dac0001f7","js_md5":"6c3d7ed6b2ac14fc26fd8af6ff7687ea","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/T32LQ2NRGa9WWHEg9ByA","published_date":"2016-07-17T07:57:16.005Z","release_notes":"","version":"1.0"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5767bcee0cc8f53b43000347/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5767bcee0cc8f53b43000347/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5767bcee0cc8f53b43000347/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5767bcee0cc8f53b43000347/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5767bcee0cc8f53b43000347/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5767bcee0cc8f53b43000347/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/5767bcee0cc8f53b43000347"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/7FGBiHJ0SQynWcYKLcaa/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/7FGBiHJ0SQynWcYKLcaa/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2016-07-19T08:55:32.422Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/2XPaA1GTDyBkLp8QhI1F/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"10 Second Ninja X Challenge","type":"watchapp","uuid":"733b0c93-fc4b-4b49-9724-2d402aaf7ad9","website":"http://www.10second.ninja/"}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
