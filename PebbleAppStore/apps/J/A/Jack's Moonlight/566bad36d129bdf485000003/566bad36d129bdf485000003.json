Jack's Moonlight will give you nightmares before your Christmas holiday. With the purchase of the license key, you can unlock additional features. Go into the watch face settings on your phone to purchase a license for $0.99 cents.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n\r\nBluetooth connection: When disconnected, the background color will go white.\r\n\r\nBattery meter: When the battery is drained, the moon is be more of a crescent. There are five stages.\r\n\r\nLicense Key Features:\r\n\r\nDate and Temperature with a flick or tap of your wrist.\r\n\r\nGet a backdrop of the current weather that includes clouds, rain, snow, lightning, and wind.\r\n\r\nAbility to get weather data form OpenWeatherMap from either GPS settings or Country and Postal Code input. Some devices may not work with GPS and the use of Postal Code will yield general results.\r\n \r\nIf you do purchase a license key and do not receive the email, check your junk folder. If you still haven't received on, email me and I will have one sent to you. \r\n\r\nThank you and enjoy!","developer_id":"56663a467da16add50000063","header_images":"","hearts":191,"id":"566bad36d129bdf485000003","latest_release":{"id":"581c14861c0888ef880000a6","js_md5":"729414bcbc32fd7247972292a8dea6f7","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/7INan2AOTLKTQXR7CJca","published_date":"2016-11-04T04:54:49.902Z","release_notes":"v1.5:\r\n\r\nFor phone where GPS is not working or disabled.
