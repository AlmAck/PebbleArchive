He's forever looking for the correct rocket parts to blast off to a new planet just like the one he's already on.\r\n\r\nEvery minute Jetman will destoy rocket parts that he doesn't like.\r\nEvery hour, he'll build his rocket and blast off.\r\n\r\nJetpac Time is battery friendly.  \r\nAfter two minutes Jetman will stop flying around, and only shoot numbers when they should change.\r\nAfter ten minutes, he'll go to sleep and the digits will change on their own. However, hourly animations will still run.\r\nYou can wake jetman by tapping your pebble. \r\n\r\nThe number of lives remaining is your Pebble's battery status.\r\n\r\nJetpac Time is inspired by the Ultimate Play the Game's classic ZX Spectrum Jetpac game from 1983.","developer_id":"52f10d571ac79403c6002c89","header_images":"","hearts":92,"id":"5571d8907dbb9e5332000050","latest_release":{"id":"5579809817cc977f36000020","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/xgClDJcXRLS3vbXvPsVt","published_date":"2015-06-11T12:35:47.297Z","release_notes":"Thanks for all of the Hearts! \r\n\r\n* Added a static \"at a glance\" screen for when Jetman goes to sleep so that the time can easily be seen.\r\n* Shake your watch to put it back into \"play the game\" mode.\r\n* Reduced the timeout to sleep from 10 to 5 minutes.\r\n\r\nColours on Pebble Time are still a work in progress - can only check values in the emulator, so don't know how they look on a real watch.
