The third row displays five minutes per segment and the last row shows single minutes. \r\nAdd them together and it gives you the current time. Allow a week to get used to this elaborate system.\r\nLet your inner nerd fly!","developer_id":"548dc3fda7785f275d0000ce","hearts":27,"id":"549c397545afeeee6700048e","latest_release":{"id":"549c39bedc9303de2c0004dd","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/DIXuNJJPRaev09u1H0mB","published_date":"2014-12-25T16:26:44.705Z","release_notes":"Version 1.0 ","version":"1.0"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/549c397545afeeee6700048e/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/549c397545afeeee6700048e/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/549c397545afeeee6700048e/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/549c397545afeeee6700048e/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/549c397545afeeee6700048e/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/549c397545afeeee6700048e/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/549c397545afeeee6700048e"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/XlheNlBR222IxZyyBycZ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/XlheNlBR222IxZyyBycZ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2014-12-25T16:33:22.869Z","screenshot_hardware":"aplite","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/XlheNlBR222IxZyyBycZ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"Berlin Clock","type":"watchface","uuid":"42eae65e-f8dc-4ea3-8ba6-60cf74eb0993","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
