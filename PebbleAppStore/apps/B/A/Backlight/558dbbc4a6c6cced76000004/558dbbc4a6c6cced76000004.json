This allows the light to stay on as long as the watch is pointed toward you, turning off when you turn the watch away.  Note that this will probably use more battery power.  Note also that in order to avoid the watch OS turning the backlight off, you need to probably turn on the system controlled backlight under Settings->Display, or at least turn off \"Motion enabled\".

(PebbleOS only allows one wakeup per minute.)  The program will now automatically move the enable/disable times forward by a minute or two, as needed, so there's no conflict."},{"version":"1.14","published_date":"2015-10-30T16:52:42.684Z","release_notes":"Something got messed up with regard to Backlight waking up for enable/disable.  It seems to be fixed now.\r\n"},{"version":"1.13","published_date":"2015-10-29T07:15:50.592Z","release_notes":"Fixed a bug in the appinfo.json file which caused the \"Pebble Time\" app on Android to crash!\r\n"},{"version":"1.12","published_date":"2015-10-29T00:31:23.157Z","release_notes":"Added a function to menu to allow the backlight to stay on when the watch is plugged in, regardless whether it's charging or not.\r\n\r\nFixed various minor bugs.\r\n"},{"version":"1.11","published_date":"2015-10-22T18:46:17.525Z","release_notes":"Added support for Pebble Round, which meant cleaning up the text and menus a little.  No additional functionality."},{"version":"1.10","published_date":"2015-10-16T21:12:07.702Z","release_notes":"New menu item (\"Charge light\") to configure such that the backlight will always be on while the watch is charging.\r\nCleaned up main menu handling.\r\n"},{"version":"1.9","published_date":"2015-10-15T23:23:45.298Z","release_notes":"Recompiled with SDK 3.6."},{"version":"1.8","published_date":"2015-09-05T00:26:22.211Z","release_notes":"Fixed the top level menu so that the item for setting \"Responsiveness\" actually says that now.\r\nFixed responsiveness window to not allow numbers outside the range of 1 - 100.\r\nI'll also copy the description of what \"responsiveness\" is doing into the main program description.  It was included into the release notes, but got buried after other releases happened.\r\n"},{"version":"1.7","published_date":"2015-08-18T17:00:00.268Z","release_notes":"Fixed bug where the enable and disable times were not set correctly if the time being set happens to have been earlier in the day.  It now correctly schedules this for the next day."},{"version":"1.6","published_date":"2015-07-27T16:54:30.415Z","release_notes":"When the auto-disable function is triggered, it should also force turning off the backlight, otherwise it could accidentally stay on after the background function is gone.

The background worker task already reads only 10 accelerometer events per second, which is the slowest allowed.  This new menu items allows the wearer to program the number of samples which are collected before the callback is called.  Thus, it allows programming of the responsiveness of the backlight in 1/10th second increments.  Presumably, calling the callback less often should save power at the expense of response time.  You be the judge of what you want!"},{"version":"1.3","published_date":"2015-07-09T01:45:01.759Z","release_notes":"Changed wording in menu to try to be more clear.  Added an underscore when setting enable / disable times.  Added a menu item to clear enable / disable times.  Fixed some bugs related to enable /disable times not being read back and setup properly when initially starting.\r\n"},{"version":"1.2","published_date":"2015-07-01T20:15:17.374Z","release_notes":"Fix minor bug in backlight duration where it would init to 1 the first time setting it.
