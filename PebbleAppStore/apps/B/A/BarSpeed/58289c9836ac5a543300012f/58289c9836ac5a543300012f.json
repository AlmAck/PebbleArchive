This is your app!\r\n\r\nBarSpeed is a simple, no frills app that turns your Pebble watch into a velocity-measurement device. Simply start the app and press the start button. At the end of your set BarSpeed will display performance data.\r\n\r\nNote: This app does not use an advanced scientific model but is more than accurate enough for most of us. Why pay $150+ for a separate workout device when you already have one on your wrist?\r\n\r\nFrom the Developer: This is a pet project for myself, which is why it's free. I'm hoping to add a companion app with tracking and graphing, but right now it's a side project.\r\nI'm 100% available for feedback and will do my best to support your needs.","developer_id":"5519f633a09364dc77000037","header_images":[{"orig":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/lYZXSTyDQAOmHQY0aXxU/convert?cache=true&fit=crop","720x320":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/lYZXSTyDQAOmHQY0aXxU/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=720&h=320"}],"hearts":10,"icon_image":{"28x28":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/uKVxrMTfyjErChNBpqwo/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=28&h=28","48x48":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/uKVxrMTfyjErChNBpqwo/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=48&h=48"},"id":"58289c9836ac5a543300012f","latest_release":{"id":"583b80b2ca3094c66f000189","js_md5":"e8669e4aace8caee3adcb321a8f9732b","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/h2X7IzwyQHmbsXIDGPYH","published_date":"2016-11-28T00:56:33.134Z","release_notes":"- layout adjustments (trying to make it easier to read)\r\n- Rep counter (it's not perfect, it's based on change in direction)\r\n\r\nUp Next:\r\n- more layout adjustments (multi-use icons, bigger text)\r\n- algorithm refinement (trying to weed out extraneous movement and improve rep counter)\r\n- code cleanup (it's a mess right now)","version":"1.51"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/58289c9836ac5a543300012f/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/58289c9836ac5a543300012f/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/58289c9836ac5a543300012f/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/58289c9836ac5a543300012f/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/58289c9836ac5a543300012f/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/58289c9836ac5a543300012f/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/58289c9836ac5a543300012f"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/TgyeKqoRqOsel8YlfGTA/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/TgyeKqoRqOsel8YlfGTA/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2016-11-17T03:23:41.391Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/rovAArICRCuODJQGolZz/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/dQcR9WFKSs6Hr3BYUhzH/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"BarSpeed","type":"watchapp","uuid":"205db913-bc99-4475-baf1-1747e2ee2027","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
