It guides them through activities like getting dressed and brushing teeth with the end goal in mind (e.g. leaving for school on time or bedtime). Briliâ€™s dynamic timers automatically adjust to make sure everything gets done by your deadline, even if you started late.\r\n\r\nWith Brili for Pebble, you or your child can:\r\n- see the current task and a picture of it\r\n- see a visual countdown timer\r\n- receive vibration prompts when time is running low and when time has run out\r\n- mark activities complete, which automatically starts the timer on the next activity\r\n\r\nEvery minute saved by staying on task is banked for a desirable activity at the end. Brili for Pebble allows you to access daily routines you create for your kids (or yourself!) on the Brili platform using our iOS, Android or web clients.\r\n\r\nNote: While Brili for Pebble can function without the app installed on your paired device, the Brili smartphone, tablet or web app is required to create and manage routines.
