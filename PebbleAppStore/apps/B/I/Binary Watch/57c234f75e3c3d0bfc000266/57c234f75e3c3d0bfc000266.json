Each row of blocks represent a binary number, with (currently)blue signifying a zero and yellow signifying a one.\r\n\r\nThe center shows the hours:minutes, and below that it shows the seconds.\r\nThe top shows days:months.\r\nLastly, the bottom shows you the last two decimal digits of the year converted to binary. In this case, the fifth box is filled in, which equals 2^(5-1)=16, as during the time of taking the screenshot it is 2016.\r\n\r\nStay tuned for updates, as I will try to release them. I will possibly add more functions, such as telling you the battery level or whatnot, and I will hopefully add settings that allow you to customize the colors for this watchface.\r\n\r\nIf you like this app and want to support me, you can do so by donating here:\r\nhttp://andrewkrapivin.xyz/donate.html","developer_id":"57a39f911482cd2d6e000247","header_images":"","hearts":4,"id":"57c234f75e3c3d0bfc000266","latest_release":{"id":"57c2350a5e3c3d18540002aa","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/sqcnyPeJTDmlUeE7eLC9","published_date":"2016-08-28T01:21:31.535Z","release_notes":"","version":"1.0"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57c234f75e3c3d0bfc000266/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57c234f75e3c3d0bfc000266/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57c234f75e3c3d0bfc000266/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57c234f75e3c3d0bfc000266/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57c234f75e3c3d0bfc000266/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57c234f75e3c3d0bfc000266/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/57c234f75e3c3d0bfc000266"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/VbVpwUUlRpu9pkY8IN2O/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/VbVpwUUlRpu9pkY8IN2O/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2016-08-28T01:21:34.750Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/VbVpwUUlRpu9pkY8IN2O/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"https://github.com/awesommee333/BinaryWatch","title":"Binary Watch","type":"watchface","uuid":"1848897b-c2ef-4bdf-9b2c-cc6e844efd73","website":"http://andrewkrapivin.xyz"}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
