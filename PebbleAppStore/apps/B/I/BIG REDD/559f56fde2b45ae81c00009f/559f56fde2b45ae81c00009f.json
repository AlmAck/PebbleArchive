I found a lot of type hard to read with other news reader apps, so this is my attempt to make my own.  It is very simple as it just gets the headlines, other apps can be found with more features.  This is just what works for me and i thought i would share.  If you have interest in more features please reach out to me and i will try to add.","developer_id":"553585ea8a7157c063000012","header_images":[{"orig":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/A4ENqU43Rkq6VKaUdpeC/convert?cache=true&fit=crop","720x320":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/A4ENqU43Rkq6VKaUdpeC/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=720&h=320"}],"hearts":12,"icon_image":{"28x28":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/ZFEIFdwRgqIOU59KvOqQ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=28&h=28","48x48":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/ZFEIFdwRgqIOU59KvOqQ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=48&h=48"},"id":"559f56fde2b45ae81c00009f","latest_release":{"id":"5764c6483feaee913e000049","js_md5":"690cd775b88357738eeeb8d1d768aaac","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/r3CzyLtkTZSQhoHhjmTD","published_date":"2016-06-30T02:37:18.025Z","release_notes":"1.2 added support for Chalk","version":"1.2"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/559f56fde2b45ae81c00009f/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/559f56fde2b45ae81c00009f/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/559f56fde2b45ae81c00009f/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/559f56fde2b45ae81c00009f/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/559f56fde2b45ae81c00009f/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/559f56fde2b45ae81c00009f/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/559f56fde2b45ae81c00009f"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/runi1SSSYuFW90occEHx/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/runi1SSSYuFW90occEHx/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-07-10T05:56:25.573Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/stlohJJ4S3Sn7riGGvfq/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/p2beEte8RxinoVthispw/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"BIG REDD","type":"watchapp","uuid":"27133dbb-48ac-45b7-a8c0-3626d44c2540","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
