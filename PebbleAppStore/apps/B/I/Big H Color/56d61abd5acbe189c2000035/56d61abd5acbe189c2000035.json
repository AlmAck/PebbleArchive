I just upgraded from the Classic to the Time, and I began to miss the most useful watch face ever, Big H. It had seconds, battery, the full date, and a display of the days of the week, 3 days into the future and 3 days in the past. I couldn't live without it. So, I altered some of the assets and some of the code for Big H in order to spice it up a bit for the Pebble Time. Configuration is broken for the time being, but I think it's configured to be at its most useful. Enjoy!","developer_id":"5323338bb1aeac09c6000034","header_images":"","hearts":11,"id":"56d61abd5acbe189c2000035","latest_release":{"id":"56d62187a9b0cbb911000041","js_md5":"ec76395bd2e7cf60ee491f93c85eb07d","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/4YG8ifhHSanyycJzt82f","published_date":"2016-03-01T23:11:11.229Z","release_notes":"I'm not a coder, so this is a simple first version with no configurability.","version":"3.0"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56d61abd5acbe189c2000035/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56d61abd5acbe189c2000035/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56d61abd5acbe189c2000035/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56d61abd5acbe189c2000035/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56d61abd5acbe189c2000035/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56d61abd5acbe189c2000035/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/56d61abd5acbe189c2000035"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/Pjwj0pS3T869MVgZO7ED/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/Pjwj0pS3T869MVgZO7ED/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2016-03-01T23:11:58.986Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/Pjwj0pS3T869MVgZO7ED/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/0CdMcJdjSwaHAyn5Fg3T/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"Big H Color","type":"watchface","uuid":"454bbe39-1b59-47b0-9673-9cbb60b238c4","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
