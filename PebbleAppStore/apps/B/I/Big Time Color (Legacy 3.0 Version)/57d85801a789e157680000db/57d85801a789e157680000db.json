An optional analog second hand (we know how useful they can be);\r\n2. An optional date and two-week calendar, which appears upon wrist shake (duration is configurable);\r\n3. An optional battery indicator; and\r\n4. An optional Bluetooth-connection icon to alert you if your watch has disconnected from your phone (yes, it'll vibrate on disconnect/reconnect).","developer_id":"53040fb83985adc79100005c","header_images":"","hearts":12,"id":"57d85801a789e157680000db","latest_release":{"id":"57e1670d16a229b23e0000c7","js_md5":"5886775c720550c069d22606502a03d0","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/aQ03VLY5T6yTOhC3Wb5g","published_date":"2016-09-20T16:43:14.251Z","release_notes":"Recompiled with Linux / Pebble SDK rather than CloudPebble","version":"3.6"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57d85801a789e157680000db/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57d85801a789e157680000db/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57d85801a789e157680000db/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57d85801a789e157680000db/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57d85801a789e157680000db/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57d85801a789e157680000db/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/57d85801a789e157680000db"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/17wgypvhS9SlbAptIZ08/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/17wgypvhS9SlbAptIZ08/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2016-09-20T16:43:24.568Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/17wgypvhS9SlbAptIZ08/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/WIwyty4QF6EHiqOB1rWw/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/r7fOsGhSI65MM6qZQCyk/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"Big Time Color (Legacy 3.0 Version)","type":"watchface","uuid":"34bb47ef-8810-4bf9-bc7d-a98b4bac4ccf","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
