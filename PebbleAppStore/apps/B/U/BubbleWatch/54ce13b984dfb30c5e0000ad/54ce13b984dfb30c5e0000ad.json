The time is shown using 75 bubbles. And when the clock ticks, a beautiful animation will change the digits.\r\n\r\nATTENTION: This watch face use a lot of resources and may be a bit laggy sometimes.\r\nATTENTION: BubbleWatch can drain a lot of battery.\r\n\r\nATTENTION: There is ABSOLUTELY NO EASTER EGG, so don't try to shake the watch to much (or to long). Bubbles wouldn't start to fly around (would they? :D )\r\n\r\nAlso check out my other WatchFace (FlexWatch), it's minimalistic, but show you all you need when you shake ;)","developer_id":"544ecc68e7900e91a00000d0","hearts":7,"id":"54ce13b984dfb30c5e0000ad","latest_release":{"id":"54ce15882f1205fb210000d8","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/yfMzpusSz2PZMU16vgA5","published_date":"2015-02-01T12:01:25.482Z","release_notes":"Version 1.0:\r\n- First Release\r\n- Animations\r\n- Bubbles\r\n- Seconds","version":"1.0"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54ce13b984dfb30c5e0000ad/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54ce13b984dfb30c5e0000ad/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54ce13b984dfb30c5e0000ad/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54ce13b984dfb30c5e0000ad/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54ce13b984dfb30c5e0000ad/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54ce13b984dfb30c5e0000ad/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/54ce13b984dfb30c5e0000ad"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/7mZImsh9SnOwYpgx8yZ9/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/7mZImsh9SnOwYpgx8yZ9/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-02-01T12:01:32.197Z","screenshot_hardware":"aplite","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/7mZImsh9SnOwYpgx8yZ9/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/TLEMmqIsSOiaaNLEm1W4/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/gR6LPczyQsejGBHoEcUq/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"BubbleWatch","type":"watchface","uuid":"24e1bf1d-8907-498b-bbc0-8fba1cbfdba6","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
