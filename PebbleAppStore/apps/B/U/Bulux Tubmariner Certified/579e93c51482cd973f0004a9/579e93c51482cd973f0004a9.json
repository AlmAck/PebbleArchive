Yes, its a spoof on the classic Rolex Submariner. Many hours were spent fine tuning every detail. Everything from the day of the week to the current date. Image created with Photoshop, even the Rolex fonts were used. Have fun and let me know how I can improve this.\r\n\r\nTUBMARINER\r\n33ft x 3 / 3atm\r\nPEBBLE CERTIFIED\r\n\r\nWhy Bulux? A British cuss word that has no definite meaning. \r\nCannot be used as an insult. Example: Bulux! While hitting your hand with a hammer. American equivalent would be Sh_t or F_ck. \r\n ","developer_id":"5523070137a164a117000076","header_images":"","hearts":7,"id":"579e93c51482cd973f0004a9","latest_release":{"id":"579e99661482cd673b00049f","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/5RPIOvQfRPW42bLtMifo","published_date":"2016-08-01T00:37:07.250Z","release_notes":"Version 2 with 1 more revision on route to fine tune the tiny lettering on the bottom of the watch face.","version":"1.0"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/579e93c51482cd973f0004a9/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/579e93c51482cd973f0004a9/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/579e93c51482cd973f0004a9/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/579e93c51482cd973f0004a9/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/579e93c51482cd973f0004a9/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/579e93c51482cd973f0004a9/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/579e93c51482cd973f0004a9"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/MbNemnplQamML1xEb9eQ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/MbNemnplQamML1xEb9eQ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2016-08-01T00:37:13.022Z","screenshot_hardware":"aplite","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/MbNemnplQamML1xEb9eQ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/Y9xVC9jTYC8r3ryjMaNQ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"Bulux Tubmariner Certified","type":"watchface","uuid":"13371337-692b-45e6-a31e-d83727743c51","website":"http://nicolasray.com"}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
