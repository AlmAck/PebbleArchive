So this is obviously a much much smaller and less detailed version. The larger map uses free data from http://www.naturalearthdata.com/  and will be ideal as a wall map/mural.  More info is at, http://www.themapman.com/mapportfolio.html\r\n\r\n\r\nThe main feature of this watchface is that the map style changes at 6am/6pm from a day map to a night map, with your current timezone displayed above.  \r\n\r\nWeather is via Yahoo  (and has generally been working ok for me during testing).  When BT is disconnected the weather graphics disappear and there is a small x. Option for a big or small temp number.\r\n\r\nThe watchface has been developed to run on all pebble watches. As the watch displays timezone info, default text is displayed on classic pebbles, which do not know about timezones.\r\n\r\nPs: At this stage i don't plan adding day/night shadows (or similar) as there are a few other watchfaces that do this, and here i'd like to keep the whole map unobscured.","developer_id":"52d76309bd61272345000001","header_images":"","hearts":131,"id":"565b94b54f2675185500000a","latest_release":{"id":"5799797922f599d62700001d","js_md5":"55a589557d7daa549aa2413e8b3e96cb","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/65LdjOhBQQWb8FEAWSVx","published_date":"2016-07-28T03:20:18.620Z","release_notes":"fixed temp aplite","version":"1.3"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/565b94b54f2675185500000a/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/565b94b54f2675185500000a/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/565b94b54f2675185500000a/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/565b94b54f2675185500000a/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/565b94b54f2675185500000a/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/565b94b54f2675185500000a/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/565b94b54f2675185500000a"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/VTkv10aXQWuJA5QNn39P/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/VTkv10aXQWuJA5QNn39P/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-11-30T01:00:12.029Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/VTkv10aXQWuJA5QNn39P/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"https://github.com/mereed/pebbleface-naturalearth","title":"Natural Earth","type":"watchface","uuid":"bc00e37e-e039-4e65-b5ab-62a1339adfca","website":"http://www.markspebblefaces.com"}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
