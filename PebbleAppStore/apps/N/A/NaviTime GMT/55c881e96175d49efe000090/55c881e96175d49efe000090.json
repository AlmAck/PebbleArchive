It's also easy to tell if it is night/day - the corresponding hour hand turns red at daytime, and blue at nighttime (6am to 6pm). A date indicator is also at the 3-o'clock mark. For OG Pebble and Pebble steel, the colored hands are replaced with hands of different lengths - the shorter hour hand represents the hour at the custom timezone you select.","developer_id":"52e56e9c8af579432200076e","header_images":"","hearts":10,"id":"55c881e96175d49efe000090","latest_release":{"id":"55d3a745704e46a52c000039","js_md5":"0ad584f0eb73e77f6e69092139cfdb82","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/WlXoIR74TU2OAtshAuAj","published_date":"2015-08-18T21:44:54.950Z","release_notes":"Added Aplite (OG Pebble and Steel) support!
