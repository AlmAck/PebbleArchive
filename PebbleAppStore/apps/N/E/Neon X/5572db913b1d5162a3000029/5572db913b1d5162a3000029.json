Back then, when CGI wasn't used for every little thing, I liked the fact, soemone actually built alien symbols of neon tubes, that really work. I was sketching for minimalistic, square based numbers that make a cool neon tube display.\r\n\r\nThe most numbers are recognized intuitively - they look like the well known 7-segment digits without the center segment. For the 8 another encryption had to be found, to distinguish it from the 0. The = symbol it is. If it helps, it's like the 8 but just using the two voids (:) that have been stretched (=). I like this symbol here, because it goes well with the alien touch of the display. Whenever the 8 appears, the whole display apperas to be even more cryptic, as it actually is.\r\n\r\nDesign / Programming / Copyright Â© 2012, 2015 Sam Jerichow","developer_id":"54ed03c2d9c53b312f00010f","header_images":"","hearts":167,"id":"5572db913b1d5162a3000029","latest_release":{"id":"5572dd1a788211499a000036","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/oBFe0xwQAa3aMKpLJSCw","published_date":"2015-06-09T06:22:13.471Z","release_notes":"","version":"1.0"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5572db913b1d5162a3000029/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5572db913b1d5162a3000029/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5572db913b1d5162a3000029/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5572db913b1d5162a3000029/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5572db913b1d5162a3000029/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5572db913b1d5162a3000029/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/5572db913b1d5162a3000029"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/u8RkTkIRScuuawFArGFE/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/u8RkTkIRScuuawFArGFE/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-06-09T06:22:18.399Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/u8RkTkIRScuuawFArGFE/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/9dT8i3uFSd6w1AykFK6Q/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/2jKs9qJRFyPVCd7evAhA/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/5eNv3bCgTsGCs6cEN7ds/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/d2MRregoRaCPw7QUSCuP/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"Neon X","type":"watchface","uuid":"6a76b916-35ae-4e10-8912-d5df7f6fdbbf","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
