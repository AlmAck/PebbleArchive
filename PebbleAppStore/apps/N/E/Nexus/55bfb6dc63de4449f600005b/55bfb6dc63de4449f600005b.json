Please check the number overview in the preview section! The two hour numbers as well as the two minute numbers themselves are connected and build a longer glyph tha appears cryptic at the first glance. Both glyphs are placed crossing each other, forming an X, that inspired the name. The red Pebble Time and the golden Pebble Time Steel have different number colours.
