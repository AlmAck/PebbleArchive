So you have to read the small inner number first and the move outwards digit by digit. \r\n\r\nThe most numbers are recognized intuitively - they look like the well known 7-segment digits without the center segment. For the 8 another encryption had to be found, to distinguish it from the 0. The = symbol it is. If it helps, it's like the 8 but just using the two voids (:) that have been stretched (=). The display of the Neon IO looks way more cryptic than the one from Neon. It takes a bit longer to understand it, but the dense mazy style looks cool.\r\n\r\nDesign / Programming / Copyright Â© 2012, 2015 Sam Jerichow","developer_id":"54ed03c2d9c53b312f00010f","header_images":"","hearts":514,"id":"5572dd5d3b1d51c76f00002f","latest_release":{"id":"5618179d37cafa2e63000019","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/FCH8yL3qTEetGwRe6SH9","published_date":"2015-10-09T21:29:16.119Z","release_notes":"Neon IO is now available for the Pebble Time Round!
