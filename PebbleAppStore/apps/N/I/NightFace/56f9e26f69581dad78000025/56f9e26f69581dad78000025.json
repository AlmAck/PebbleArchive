NightFace keeps the CPU asleep until you shake the watch for the time. It's On-Demand!\r\n\r\nA simple shake to the watch will display the time for 5 seconds and then go back to black.\r\n\r\nThis means the best possible battery savings during the time when you don't need to know the time. You can also use this during the day to conserve battery if you're running low.\r\n\r\nIf you like NightFace give it a \"‚ù§\"\r\n\r\nAnd at 5KiB of memory, it has an ultra-tiny footprint!\r\n\r\nWatchface built for SDK3 on Original Pebble, Pebble Steel, Pebble Time, Pebble Time Steel, and Pebble Time Round. Displays 12-hour or 24-hour mode!","developer_id":"52b2903ab70e1c4cea0000d2","header_images":"","hearts":125,"id":"56f9e26f69581dad78000025","latest_release":{"id":"57696a5e3feaee5ce300048c","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/ZMgW3iaBR7O823oRGd8X","published_date":"2016-06-21T16:28:11.690Z","release_notes":"1.3 - Increased font size for time just a tad","version":"1.3"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56f9e26f69581dad78000025/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56f9e26f69581dad78000025/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56f9e26f69581dad78000025/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56f9e26f69581dad78000025/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56f9e26f69581dad78000025/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56f9e26f69581dad78000025/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/56f9e26f69581dad78000025"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/d2dGmyW5RFGdXjlbgxyG/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/d2dGmyW5RFGdXjlbgxyG/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2016-03-29T13:22:22.627Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/d2dGmyW5RFGdXjlbgxyG/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/zoNA14MXSFidZs9hys4d/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/co2RenFgQAyqDZVmaLe5/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/TvDfBR8TzSUfLvYC5N4c/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/y0UQdArxRNms1toxgAG7/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"https://github.com/gaetawoo/Pebble_NightFace","title":"NightFace","type":"watchface","uuid":"2c916c60-df56-4a8e-a6c3-c7402f7f5aae","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
