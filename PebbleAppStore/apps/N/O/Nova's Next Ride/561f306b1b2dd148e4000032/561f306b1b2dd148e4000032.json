Save frequently uses stops as favorites for quick & easy access. You can also select the color you like best\r\n\r\nPerformance Notice:\r\nThis app uses pebble.js which, according to Pebble, is still in beta. This is important to know because the app can be slow at times and it may not start up right the first time resulting in a screen that says \"Disconnected, run the pebble app\". The app has been tested and it does work but it may not work well at times. The app also makes round trip communication with your phone for each interaction. This uses up more battery on the watch which is why it is recommended to save frequently used stop.\r\n\r\nService Notice:\r\nThis app relies on data provided by the GCRTA which may change or be discontinued at any time. In the event the data is changed or discontinued the app will stop working for some time. Please do not contact the GCRTA about these issues as this app is not maintained by them.","developer_id":"560065e70d3b04b47c00008b","header_images":"","hearts":2,"icon_image":{"28x28":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/jGZTYibT9u7yQvKIrmQ1/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=28&h=28","48x48":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/jGZTYibT9u7yQvKIrmQ1/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=48&h=48"},"id":"561f306b1b2dd148e4000032","latest_release":{"id":"569ad6a4fca721d6c400006e","js_md5":"1a2568d36c6c8118664ef09034a07a50","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/LzLBmxp7TNadFbRPy1Fe","published_date":"2016-01-16T23:49:59.129Z","release_notes":"Fixed color issues on Pebble original","version":"1.2"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/561f306b1b2dd148e4000032/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/561f306b1b2dd148e4000032/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/561f306b1b2dd148e4000032/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/561f306b1b2dd148e4000032/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/561f306b1b2dd148e4000032/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/561f306b1b2dd148e4000032/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/561f306b1b2dd148e4000032"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/5eIWwSuQxirvVR1CSXmw/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/5eIWwSuQxirvVR1CSXmw/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-10-18T01:09:04.537Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/G6nz0YIsQ8gw9Zjp02s5/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/AgdkvBSmRzam34d8owm7/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/31ANyxFNRYuaHxZ94nBg/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/Io3jxhpRiyfA28OZANBw/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/SBSdLcT5mI9Lg9E9yDFA/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"http://github.com/elrond1369/nnr","title":"Nova's Next Ride","type":"watchapp","uuid":"7997e514-e9c0-4860-9ae0-2d41cb9aac39","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
