It's also inspired by the '94 film Speed where a city bus needs to stay above 50 mph.\r\n\r\nI created a standalone pebble watch face that keeps the user awake without the use of stimulants. It monitors the pebble's accelerometer - if the wearer stops moving (falls asleep) - the watch will vibrate and light up to wake the user. \r\nThe watch face displays inspirational quotes, along with the time and a convenient battery meter.
