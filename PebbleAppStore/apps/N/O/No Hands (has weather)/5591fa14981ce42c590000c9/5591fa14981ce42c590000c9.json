(Colour, Analogue, for Pebble Time). Now with optional vibrations and weather.\r\nSample times in screenshots are: 10:30PM, 8:34AM, 10:25AM.\r\n\r\n1. Hour shown to easily tell time.\r\n  * White: PM,\r\n  * Black: AM.\r\n2. Day of week & date (DDMM) in 2 rows.\r\n3. Middle spoke indicator for bluetooth connectivity & battery level.\r\n  1. bluetooth indicated by colour of centre:\r\n    * White: connected,\r\n    * Pink: disconnected.\r\n  2. battery level:\r\n    * Red: charging\r\n    * Black: draining.\r\n    * spoke rim thickness of 1 to 5 for 5 battery levels of <20% to 100%.\r\n4. Optional weather info using Yahoo Weather data: weather condition and temperature.\r\n * Configurable options to (a) Use predefined location (tested OK) or Use GPS (not tested yet), and change (b) update interval and (c) temperature units.\r\n * Yahoo has 49 different weather conditions (incl. NA).\r\n * Owing to Yahoo Weather service changes, one can no longer get weather for a country as a whole. Instead, one must specify a city/place as well. E.g. use \"sisimiut,greenland\" instead of \"Greenland\" alone, \"new york,usa\" instead of \"usa\".\r\nOptional vibrations for:\r\n    * Bluetooth connection lost: fading vibe.\r\n    * Hourly chirp. Default: Off, 10am to 8pm.\r\n\r\n\r\nInspired by Chromatick.\r\n\r\nCredits\r\nThanks to (1) sample weather codes & icons from tallerthenyou's Simple Weather watchface and alexsum's Timely watchface, (2) weather data from Yahoo.","developer_id":"5568037a1034b0abf70000a1","header_images":"","hearts":41,"id":"5591fa14981ce42c590000c9","latest_release":{"id":"55b36972408a95495a000042","js_md5":"4899f1754b799ae053184adef33a4e31","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/EROZZ1OaTXmSZ6Ct0rfG","published_date":"2015-07-26T09:35:35.782Z","release_notes":"v1.5 - Optional weather.\r\n> Separate sets of icons for light & dark background.","version":"1.5"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5591fa14981ce42c590000c9/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5591fa14981ce42c590000c9/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5591fa14981ce42c590000c9/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5591fa14981ce42c590000c9/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5591fa14981ce42c590000c9/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5591fa14981ce42c590000c9/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/5591fa14981ce42c590000c9"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/6Hyz7QUgSrmhEodq16Di/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/6Hyz7QUgSrmhEodq16Di/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-06-30T23:05:03.331Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/6Hyz7QUgSrmhEodq16Di/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/Hfvfq5K9QWG8da594DkH/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/oknh2ngUTOazPgJrh7x0/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/wPKNR6XISVmZGx0kPHZI/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"https://github.com/sdneon/NoHands","title":"No Hands (has weather)","type":"watchface","uuid":"d0544231-23ea-468f-b984-7948fe004d7f","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
