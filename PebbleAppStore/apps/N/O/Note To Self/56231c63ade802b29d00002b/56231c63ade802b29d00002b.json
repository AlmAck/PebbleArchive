Both will result in the text \"buy tickets\" in your timeline set at 4:30.\r\n\r\nDESIGN:\r\nThis app is designed to be used with minimal interaction. After speaking your command, it will be added to the timeline immediately without requiring any confirmation buttons to be pressed. If the command was successful, the watch will give off a double vibration. If an error occurs, it will give off a long vibration.\r\n\r\nRESPONSIVENESS:\r\nEvents on the timeline may take up to 15 minutes to show up.\r\n\r\nMISC:\r\nAll events are pushed to your Pebble timeline and not saved elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIf you set the app as as a quick launch shortcut, it closes the app after the event is added.","developer_id":"547a03513f44377417000034","header_images":[{"orig":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/dsp41YCVShOG8ulwfeTR/convert?cache=true&fit=crop","720x320":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/dsp41YCVShOG8ulwfeTR/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=720&h=320"},{"orig":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/B6uaA558RAilLvnP4WS8/convert?cache=true&fit=crop","720x320":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/B6uaA558RAilLvnP4WS8/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=720&h=320"}],"hearts":924,"icon_image":{"28x28":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/khnlGvjqRfu54WoxVmxV/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=28&h=28","48x48":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/khnlGvjqRfu54WoxVmxV/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=48&h=48"},"id":"56231c63ade802b29d00002b","latest_release":{"id":"581abbe044d606c91500009c","js_md5":"12df6e04605c45cba7d5e66ebf2ceba2","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/OggSA52wTHKbomDTXEKi","published_date":"2016-11-03T05:53:27.598Z","release_notes":"Fixed noon time as PM and support Emery.","version":"1.11"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56231c63ade802b29d00002b/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56231c63ade802b29d00002b/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56231c63ade802b29d00002b/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56231c63ade802b29d00002b/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56231c63ade802b29d00002b/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56231c63ade802b29d00002b/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/56231c63ade802b29d00002b"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/gUGmsr8R0qbhbxsbHKch/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/gUGmsr8R0qbhbxsbHKch/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-10-18T05:03:02.778Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/IguIqKxEStycYYKJJjhA/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/crSlZtVRkGc3TJTRvRkQ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"Note To Self","type":"watchapp","uuid":"516e319e-f227-4f7f-8a72-59955fa673ce","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
