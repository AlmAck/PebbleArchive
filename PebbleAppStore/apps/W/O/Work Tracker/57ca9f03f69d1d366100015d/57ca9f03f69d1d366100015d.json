When you start work you begin a new shift in the app. During your work you can keep track of how many hours you have worked, how many hours you spent on breaks and the total hours and wage you've earned during your shift.\r\n\r\nYou can exit the app at any time during the shift and tend to other things. The app will continue with updated time values when you load it again.\r\n\r\nIf you miss a shift or otherwise need to change the hours for the period, you can do so in the configure window.\r\n\r\nIn the configure window you can also change other settings like the hourly pay and view the hours for the last period.","developer_id":"531a054095b1ea6f69000155","header_images":[{"orig":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/890dpUgNSMKNq1lZ3y6K/convert?cache=true&fit=crop","720x320":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/890dpUgNSMKNq1lZ3y6K/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=720&h=320"}],"hearts":6,"icon_image":{"28x28":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/xvxQSNqQVmiZ0Ps8CNlg/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=28&h=28","48x48":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/xvxQSNqQVmiZ0Ps8CNlg/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=48&h=48"},"id":"57ca9f03f69d1d366100015d","latest_release":{"id":"57caa0a0be5ad096ff000169","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/ZvJcLmVrQQK8gpzSkt9v","published_date":"2016-09-03T10:48:50.272Z","release_notes":"Version 1.0\r\n\r\nThis is the first release version of the app.\r\n\r\nI tried to squeeze this app to a size that would fit on the classic pebbles (aplite).
