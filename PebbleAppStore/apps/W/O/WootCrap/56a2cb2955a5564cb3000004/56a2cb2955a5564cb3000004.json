With WootCrap, your house will soon be filled with cheap crap! During one of Woot’s famous Woot-Offs, just leave this app open on your Pebble and it will track the status of the current item, with vibrations to notify you when the item is almost sold out, is sold out, and when there’s a new item. To help you collect as much crap as possible, when a wild Bag of Crap appears, the Pebble will vibrate urgently so you don’t miss out.\r\n\r\nWhen you have WootCrap open and a Woot-Off is happening, the app constantly fetches updates from Woot.com to show you the current item up for sale as well as that item’s price, percent remaining, and estimated time remaining. It intelligently decides how often it should be checking the Woot site based on how much of the sale is remaining to help save their servers and save your battery life. Even when it’s not a Woot-Off day, you can use the app to see the current Woot. The watch’s up and down buttons can be used to cycle through the different Woot categories.\r\n\r\nYou have the option of setting a daily notification time in the app’s settings, so that every day you can know what is the new item for sale on Woot.\r\n\r\nAdditional Woot-Off Features:\r\n- Vibrates when there are 5% or less of the current item remaining, so if you’re trying to find a Bag of Crap, you have time to prepare for the next item by refreshing your login\r\n- Vibrates again when an item is sold out, and when a new item is up for sale\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: This app is not affiliated with Woot Inc.","developer_id":"54cbc3b00a912f754500000c","header_images":[{"orig":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/ncsP1b9TIqFc2hxONl0g/convert?cache=true&fit=crop","720x320":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/ncsP1b9TIqFc2hxONl0g/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=720&h=320"}],"hearts":13,"icon_image":{"28x28":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/x0FnkkNQVGMy9sTGFiVh/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=28&h=28","48x48":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/x0FnkkNQVGMy9sTGFiVh/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=48&h=48"},"id":"56a2cb2955a5564cb3000004","latest_release":{"id":"58189f8ac68d0087f8000066","js_md5":"83c8ad7bf74d4aa7f5a262d5f9394e52","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/YkTeQL2URUiCKoOv8mWv","published_date":"2016-11-01T13:58:49.557Z","release_notes":"","version":"1.13"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56a2cb2955a5564cb3000004/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56a2cb2955a5564cb3000004/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56a2cb2955a5564cb3000004/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56a2cb2955a5564cb3000004/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56a2cb2955a5564cb3000004/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56a2cb2955a5564cb3000004/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/56a2cb2955a5564cb3000004"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/pbkNs3VQeHw0KbHzyTmQ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/pbkNs3VQeHw0KbHzyTmQ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2016-01-26T14:47:28.516Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/W9WFyfrsQKuRAmvF9iDZ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/u0VMKHxLRYGcnwpufRtR/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/Zmpf7rCfTpsU77q8vEpf/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/v9CEQWQkQLPkb0Iav8Gi/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"https://github.com/JessicaYeh/WootCrap","title":"WootCrap","type":"watchapp","uuid":"7c94c59c-1ee4-433f-9b34-37db2d8dd736","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
