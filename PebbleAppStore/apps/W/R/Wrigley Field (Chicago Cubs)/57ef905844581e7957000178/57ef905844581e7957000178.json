An attempt was made to faithfully reproduce all aspects of our favorite scoreboard clock. Shake the watch or twist your wrist to display the current date and day of the week for 5 seconds (and a warning if Bluetooth is disconnected).\r\n\r\nIf you also own an original Pebble, Pebble 2, Time Round, or Time 2, this watchface is available in versions specific to your platform.\r\n\r\nComments, feedback, bug reports, and feature suggestions are welcome! The code behind this watchface will be open-source and is currently freely available on request. Please e-mail me for any of these reasons.","developer_id":"5799673b22f599f05b000112","header_images":"","hearts":10,"id":"57ef905844581e7957000178","latest_release":{"id":"583e269aca3094d3b000063f","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/Z4ClUr4eRJWSWUXjAvjO","published_date":"2016-11-30T03:34:13.845Z","release_notes":"- Full support for Timeline Quick View resizing\r\n- Improved icons in menu list, including adding transparency\r\n- Minor improvements to scaling of watch hands\r\n- Added Bluetooth disconnection warning on shake/tap\r\n- Added Emery (Pebble Time 2) support\r\n\r\nVersion 1.2 will be this release when it is confirmed stable or any bugs are fixed.
