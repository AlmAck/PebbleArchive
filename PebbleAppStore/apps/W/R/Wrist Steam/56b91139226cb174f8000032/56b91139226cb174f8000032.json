In development since mid-2014, Wrist Steam allows you to safely - and conveniently - link your Steam user profile to Wrist Steam via Steam's OpenID authentication service. As of right now, Wrist Steam allows you to view your own profile info, but more features are in the works, such as Friends Info (allowing you to see and track your friends activities within Steam), and (possibly) Wrist-TF2, a feature which could allow you to track your TF2 inventory on the go!
