The app is free and does not require any companion apps.\r\n\r\nQuick Instructions:\r\n\r\n1. Download the app.\r\n2. Go to the Pebble app and select Wink Shortcuts settings.\r\n3. Log into your Wink account and tap Save.\r\n\r\nTo speed up the loading process, the first time your shortcuts get loaded, they also get cached inside the app. This saves loading time and helps you get to your shortcuts faster! \r\n\r\nWhen you add or delete shortcuts to your Wink App you can easily refresh the list by selecting \"Refresh\" from the menu.\r\n\r\nA few notes:\r\n\r\nThe number of items below the shortcut name includes groups as well as devices.\r\n\r\nThis app was created using the Wink API but it is not made by Wink. There's no collection of data by the app and all the credentials are sent to Wink directly.\r\n\r\n If you find any issues please let me know.","developer_id":"52f04d2161b75250fb0012e1","header_images":[{"orig":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/W69ESZVrQjimVe9R7eJZ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop","720x320":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/W69ESZVrQjimVe9R7eJZ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=720&h=320"}],"hearts":63,"icon_image":{"28x28":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/yooh5JH6TOKdYlpa9DJQ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=28&h=28","48x48":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/yooh5JH6TOKdYlpa9DJQ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=48&h=48"},"id":"558e090c1b71520df2000038","latest_release":{"id":"55936fd185ea119a8b00000a","js_md5":"79f64a087782c83b9b25dd2782ec3181","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/esfhSq6ISecrP7gCM3qg","published_date":"2015-07-01T04:43:35.249Z","release_notes":"- Fixed issues with original Pebble devices.\r\n- More color on Pebble Time.\r\n","version":"0.2"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/558e090c1b71520df2000038/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/558e090c1b71520df2000038/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/558e090c1b71520df2000038/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/558e090c1b71520df2000038/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/558e090c1b71520df2000038/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/558e090c1b71520df2000038/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/558e090c1b71520df2000038"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/zuIuumunRcSWHLvHfVYH/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/zuIuumunRcSWHLvHfVYH/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-06-27T03:00:50.650Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/UXOmLlqOTxi1YnAawZng/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/PTtADe5uS52lQOkFaxDV/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/tDWroipiRnOB06xD7maZ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/WwKi47krRWOrQwvMfOLk/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"Wink Shortcuts","type":"watchapp","uuid":"6c8a233a-c119-4b93-beaa-ffeb59b34992","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
