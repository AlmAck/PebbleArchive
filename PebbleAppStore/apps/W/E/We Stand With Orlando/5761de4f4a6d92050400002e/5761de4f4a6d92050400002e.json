In 2013 there were 33,169 gun-related deaths. That's roughly one every 15 minutes. This will vibrate every 15 minutes as a reminder. And not just any vibration. It will pulse 3 times in 1.25 seconds. That’s the frequency of shots used by the gun in the Pulse nightclub shootings. These weapons have no place in the hands of any civilian.\r\n\r\nIf you want to act like the NRA or many politicians and not be alerted every 15 minutes then please go to the settings page and select the “No thanks, I'll ignore the problem with America” option. We wouldn’t want to inconvenience those that only want to send their thoughts and prayers.","developer_id":"52f00ca61ac79451370000d1","header_images":"","hearts":47,"id":"5761de4f4a6d92050400002e","latest_release":{"id":"57f2df4b3c754afb59000018","js_md5":"3cf3f1efc1c30a8ebebf28640eb953df","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/nQf0Rx1zTmmJ15vjvFGz","published_date":"2016-10-03T22:45:09.055Z","release_notes":"- Moved configuration page to new site\r\n- Support for Pebble 2","version":"1.1"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5761de4f4a6d92050400002e/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5761de4f4a6d92050400002e/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5761de4f4a6d92050400002e/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5761de4f4a6d92050400002e/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5761de4f4a6d92050400002e/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5761de4f4a6d92050400002e/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/5761de4f4a6d92050400002e"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/T6eHitKTC2kk4GWILFbP/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/T6eHitKTC2kk4GWILFbP/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2016-06-15T23:41:40.034Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/T6eHitKTC2kk4GWILFbP/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"We Stand With Orlando","type":"watchface","uuid":"48ebdbae-c239-43df-8318-d363f5214a08","website":"https://www.gofundme.com/PulseVictimsFund"}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
