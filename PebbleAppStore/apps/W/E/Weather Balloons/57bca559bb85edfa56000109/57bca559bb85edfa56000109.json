Colour of hour balloon reflects day/night (based on sunrise/sunset).\r\n\r\nChoice of weather providers: OpenWeatherMap, Forecast.io or Weather Underground.  As with many other weather watchfaces, you need to get a free API key from the weather provider you want to use.  All give at least 500 free calls per day (far more than needed). Until API key provided, weather icon & temperature areas are blank.\r\n\r\nTo get key, register at one of these:\r\n OWM: https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up\r\n Forecast.io: https://developer.forecast.io/register\r\n Weather Underground: https://www.wunderground.com/member/registration \r\n (select Columus Plan to get forecast info)\r\n\r\nAll find weather for current latitude/longitude.\r\n\r\nTemperature appears in minute balloon (Farenheit or Celcius), weather icon within hour balloon. \r\n  \r\nWith Forecast.io & Weather Underground, option to present balloons with forecast for today & next 4 days on a shake of the wrist.  The \"tails\" are in hour analog positions (0 for today, 1 for tomorrow etc).\r\n\r\nBalloons can be ordered:\r\n- Rising: Today highest, then tomorrow etc\r\n- Analog: Arranged around face in analog sequence\r\n\r\nFor Quick Views, location name and forecast inhibited. \r\n\r\nAnimation sequence:\r\n  2:40AM (San Francisco)\r\n  3:55PM (Shanghai)\r\n12:30PM (London)\r\n5 day forecast (rising)\r\n5 day forecast (analog)","developer_id":"54547c1fe77c14d0a1000033","header_images":"","hearts":14,"id":"57bca559bb85edfa56000109","latest_release":{"id":"57dd112a2d0cc8922f000289","js_md5":"7e5fbabf1a449e75c83c93b7c20b0832","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/Fc8khyQUyqYzEUkfltGQ","published_date":"2016-09-17T09:47:32.963Z","release_notes":"Added support for Pebble 2 and Quick Views.
