Time (of course), date, compass heading and direction, weather, location, and battery/bluetooth status.  This was developed to scratch an itch for an all purpose, low battery drain watch face for hiking, camping, and all around usage.  No configuration for now, though that is likely to change.  Tap/Shake will enable compass, which will then go back to sleep when activity is not detected.  Between 10pm and 6am, a low power mode is engaged, stopping the second blink, and requiring a triple tap or vigorous shake to re-enable the compass.  Weather is synced on the hour.","developer_id":"55f77b489020d6ce2800003f","header_images":"","hearts":19,"id":"560054ef9f4d474a4a00006f","latest_release":{"id":"56200fc21c05d05ff6000001","js_md5":"3d6afb4af10e150caaf8dc5f64e30299","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/CfixPisfS8Ol54mg7WNX","published_date":"2015-10-15T20:43:00.309Z","release_notes":"Now with Seconds!","version":"3.1"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/560054ef9f4d474a4a00006f/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/560054ef9f4d474a4a00006f/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/560054ef9f4d474a4a00006f/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/560054ef9f4d474a4a00006f/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/560054ef9f4d474a4a00006f/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/560054ef9f4d474a4a00006f/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/560054ef9f4d474a4a00006f"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/jx4skGqZS4mNMgA4rxAL/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/jx4skGqZS4mNMgA4rxAL/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-09-21T19:19:33.185Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/jx4skGqZS4mNMgA4rxAL/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"WatchInfo","type":"watchface","uuid":"77969548-2b85-4662-990a-5f7ead0412df","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
