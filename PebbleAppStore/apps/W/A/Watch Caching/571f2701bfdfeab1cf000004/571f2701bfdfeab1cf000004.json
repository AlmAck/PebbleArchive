Now uses Geocaching Live API. This means that you will need to re-authenticate in the settings, and basic members will only be able to get locations of traditional caches.\r\n2. Renamed from \"Geocaching\" to \"Watch Caching\" because \"Geocaching\" as an app name is trademarked by Groundspeak.\r\n3. Now uses corrected coordinates. If a user has entered corrected coordinates for a geocache, they will be used. (This only applies to Premium members because you can't have corrected coordinates on a traditional geocache)\r\n4. Date is displayed in status bar. You no longer have to exit the app to see the date so you can write it down in logs!"},{"version":"0.4","published_date":"2016-05-01T19:38:12.301Z","release_notes":"Fixed crash when parsing geocaches (including on startup) on monochrome watches"},{"version":"0.3","published_date":"2016-05-01T09:02:47.311Z","release_notes":"- Now working for Android 5+ users!\r\n- Now shows arrow instead of tuning message when compass is still tuning because some users reported it never finishing tuning."},{"version":"0.2","published_date":"2016-04-28T12:59:08.506Z","release_notes":"Fixed an issue where users weren't able to log in if language was not set to English on geocaching website"},{"version":"0.1","published_date":"2016-04-26T08:55:05.439Z","release_notes":"First release"}],"companions":{"ios":null,"android":null},"compatibility":{"ios":{"supported":true,"min_js_version":-1},"android":{"supported":true},"aplite":{"supported":true,"firmware":{"major":3}},"basalt":{"supported":true,"firmware":{"major":3}},"chalk":{"supported":true,"firmware":{"major":3}},"diorite":{"supported":true,"firmware":{"major":3}},"emery":{"supported":true,"firmware":{"major":3}}},"created_at":"2016-04-26T08:29:53.093Z","description":"Watch Caching enables you to navigate to nearby geocaches using only your pebble smartwatch.\r\n\r\nIt will retrieve a list of up to 50 nearby geocaches from geocaching.com and, using the compass in the watch and the GPS in your phone, will show you the distance and direction so that you can find the geocache without ever taking your phone out of your pocket.\r\n\r\nBecause of Geocaching Live API limitiations, basic members will only be able to get details of traditional geocaches.","developer_id":"556ecee8ec2818f5cb000091","header_images":[{"orig":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/JAYNsTIXRh2WhnFGBOoA/convert?cache=true&fit=crop","720x320":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/JAYNsTIXRh2WhnFGBOoA/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=720&h=320"}],"hearts":76,"icon_image":{"28x28":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/yC5EOuQTSEyTpBHgZaL7/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=28&h=28","48x48":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/yC5EOuQTSEyTpBHgZaL7/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=48&h=48"},"id":"571f2701bfdfeab1cf000004","latest_release":{"id":"57f4f24de5cdfd3abe000066","js_md5":"aa05100668eb2471cf67740d8e9cb8fe","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/T5DaLSmpTAaFINhSkvDq","published_date":"2016-10-05T12:30:45.189Z","release_notes":"Removed code that set location to always be somewhere in the UK, instead of where the GPS says you are!\r\n\r\nAlso changed menu icon for Pebble OS 4","version":"1.4"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/571f2701bfdfeab1cf000004/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/571f2701bfdfeab1cf000004/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/571f2701bfdfeab1cf000004/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/571f2701bfdfeab1cf000004/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/571f2701bfdfeab1cf000004/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/571f2701bfdfeab1cf000004/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/571f2701bfdfeab1cf000004"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/QS85LlZWQhi8UK7Exaib/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/QS85LlZWQhi8UK7Exaib/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2016-06-01T09:03:21.330Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/YcuryE19RwWxyWiPVVoj/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/bmbFNflGTpWV5jJvjyIr/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/0NoIf1KUTNANjZelU6qj/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"Watch Caching","type":"watchapp","uuid":"905612e5-7117-4e8b-9872-1be09956e187","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
