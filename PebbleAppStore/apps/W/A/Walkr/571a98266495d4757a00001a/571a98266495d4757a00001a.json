Walkr uses the built-in health kit in your Pebble.\r\nWhen launched Walkr will show the last recorded values.\r\nTo start a new lap, press the play button. You can pause anytime by pressing the pause button. To end a lap, press the stop button twice within a 5 seconds time frame.\r\nExiting the app will stop the lap as well.\r\nWarning: do not rely on this app to give you a complete and precise readout. The app uses the Health Service and inherits the deficiencies of the Health Services.","developer_id":"52bc98fc530bf4ed75000183","header_images":"","hearts":15,"icon_image":{"28x28":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/uopn84QTfSeuBVJVru69/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=28&h=28","48x48":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/uopn84QTfSeuBVJVru69/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=48&h=48"},"id":"571a98266495d4757a00001a","latest_release":{"id":"57210636a4a73c083d000006","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/H5hyXXbkQdq4uygzzF4r","published_date":"2016-04-27T18:34:44.476Z","release_notes":"Added support for Aplite (Pebble Classic) and Chalk (Pebble Round) platforms.","version":"1.1"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/571a98266495d4757a00001a/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/571a98266495d4757a00001a/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/571a98266495d4757a00001a/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/571a98266495d4757a00001a/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/571a98266495d4757a00001a/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/571a98266495d4757a00001a/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/571a98266495d4757a00001a"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/aSqemX5vRSSgxkL2Zpi4/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/aSqemX5vRSSgxkL2Zpi4/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2016-04-22T21:40:20.153Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/EWXOWTePR1ONl21wnJPg/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"https://github.com/bschau/Walkr","title":"Walkr","type":"watchapp","uuid":"5cbf0920-f1cc-4b66-8fba-ea402671c0d3","website":"http://www.schau.dk"}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
