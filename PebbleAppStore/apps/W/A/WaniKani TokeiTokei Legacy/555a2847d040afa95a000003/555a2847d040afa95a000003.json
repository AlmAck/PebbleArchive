Japanese is not natively supported by Pebble. http://wh.to/pebble/index_jp.html\r\n\r\nWaniKani  on your Pebble watch! Immerse yourself not only with the time, but your most difficult words. This app takes a snapshot of your WaniKani profile every hour to provide you with the most  to date vocabulary throughout your . Currently grabs any words under 70% [correct] rating. If your difficult words aren't for you, you can also change it to display recent unlocks or no words at all. Due to popular demand, activity mode is now available; showing only your due queue on WaniKani.

He performed much more work than I did and without his effort, this watch-face would not have come to fruition.  \r\n\r\nThe javascript which this is written in runs on your phone. The delay function only works if the app is in the foreground for the entire hour. Working on finding a better solution. For the time being, toggling away and back to the watch-face will update it manually.","developer_id":"554ba2255fa04f8b99000056","header_images":"","hearts":18,"id":"555a2847d040afa95a000003","latest_release":{"id":"5565624b39861092b9000027","js_md5":"707e15775a14acaffecd54f974b88dac","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/mo6x06UeQ6ytEZAdPHeO","published_date":"2015-05-27T06:21:09.810Z","release_notes":"Added last card to memory.
