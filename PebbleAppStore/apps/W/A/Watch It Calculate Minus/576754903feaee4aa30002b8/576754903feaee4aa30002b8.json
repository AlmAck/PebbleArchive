'Watch It Calculate', just like mama used to make. It might suit your fancy.\r\n\r\nDo you love math? Of course you don't, but you will after using this WatchFace and watch as math does your bidding, but telling you the time of day.\r\n\r\nNot convinced, you shouldn't be, this is math we're talking about. But just look at all those, satisfying images... Mmmmm... Tasty.....\r\n\r\nGive it a twirl why don't you, and watch your hate for math windle as you watch it struggle to do simple addition and subtraction.\r\n\r\nHonest description: It's a simple WatchFace for telling time, the date, and your battery level. There's also a little twist when telling time. When a minute goes by, +1 or +1 and -9, simple calculator like digital flipping, to show as if the watch is a calculator, that can tell time. Nothing fancy I suppose, but not easy to code/make. I'm sure you'd love it either way.\r\n\r\n-Tells time\r\n-Tells battery level\r\n-Tells date\r\n-Tells math to do your bidding","developer_id":"5765431e0cc8f54d250000a4","header_images":"","hearts":7,"id":"576754903feaee4aa30002b8","latest_release":{"id":"5767611b3feaeefc1b0002e4","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/pYFUFsaoQQ2gQFTHuwTO","published_date":"2016-06-20T03:30:31.546Z","release_notes":"First build, enjoy!","version":"1.0"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/576754903feaee4aa30002b8/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/576754903feaee4aa30002b8/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/576754903feaee4aa30002b8/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/576754903feaee4aa30002b8/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/576754903feaee4aa30002b8/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/576754903feaee4aa30002b8/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/576754903feaee4aa30002b8"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/huBDUPWRGGMc6liyuyOI/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/huBDUPWRGGMc6liyuyOI/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2016-06-20T03:30:36.662Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/huBDUPWRGGMc6liyuyOI/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/6MXGldNT1uNS576TQasC/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/rpB02LeNQZeVmS3qJNPs/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"https://github.com/TheYellowHat/Watch-It-Calculate-Minus","title":"Watch It Calculate Minus","type":"watchface","uuid":"3ca8f487-761f-49b2-8207-25dd5a5a3c71","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
