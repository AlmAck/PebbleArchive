That player moves the watch in one fluid motion. To signify that the action has been recorded, the watch will vibrate and the MimeStone puts on his game face. The watch is then passed on to the next player. This player has to do the action performed by the player before him, and then add his own action. Performing the right moves makes the MimeStone happy, but getting a move wrong will make him cry and that player will be eliminated. Each successive player does all of the actions of the players before him/her, and then adds their own. When a player is eliminated the list of moves resets, and the other players continue as if they started a new game. The last player remaining is the winner !
