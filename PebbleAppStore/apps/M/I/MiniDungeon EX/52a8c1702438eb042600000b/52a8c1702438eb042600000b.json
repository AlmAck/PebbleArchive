You just wait for the watch to tell you to do interact with it. Now with stamina, you are able to move through the dungeon yourself. You are given at the begin of the game 10 of stamina, each time you use one, you advance in the dungeon. The stamina recovers  X every minutes, where X is your level.  The limit of stamina you can gather is directly linked to your level. \r\n\r\nScore Calculator\r\n\r\nAt the end of the game, a score is not calculated and given to the player. It's possible that later on I implement a leaderboard online using Pebble.JS. I prefer to keep for now secret the formula used to calculate the score (even if it's public in the source code).\r\n\r\nEasy Mode\r\n\r\nWhen activated, the player can choose to climb or not to the next floor, the limit for increasing stats is disable (usually you can't increase your stat more than your level) and when you die you can choose to continue playing from where you where.
