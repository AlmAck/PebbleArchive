So we've added a setting for that. It's called \"Battery saving mode\". It works :)\r\n\r\nWe've also made other improvements to performance and battery life, and have added the ability to manage your own step target rather than using your average steps from the last 7 days (this is optional).\r\n\r\nComing soon: selectable themes.\r\n\r\nThanks for using minim!"},{"version":"1.1","published_date":"2016-03-01T03:04:29.067Z","release_notes":"We've added support for Pebble Health! The following features are automatically enabled if you're using Pebble's \"Health\" app and have at least 1 day of activity data available:\r\n\r\n(1) The outer ring is now a progress bar for today's steps. Complete the circle by reaching your average daily step count (calculated over the last 7 days). The centre pin turns green when you complete the circle. A future version will allow you to set your target step count if desired.\r\n\r\n(2) When Pebble determines you're having a \"restful sleep\", the seconds hand is disabled to save battery, and the other hands are only moved every 60 seconds.\r\n\r\nWe've made some other improvements that should improve battery life too. Enjoy :)"},{"version":"1.0","published_date":"2016-02-27T10:25:25.332Z","release_notes":"Initial release."}],"companions":{"ios":null,"android":null},"compatibility":{"ios":{"supported":true,"min_js_version":-1},"android":{"supported":true},"aplite":{"supported":false,"firmware":{"major":3}},"basalt":{"supported":true,"firmware":{"major":3}},"chalk":{"supported":true,"firmware":{"major":3}},"diorite":{"supported":false,"firmware":{"major":3}},"emery":{"supported":true,"firmware":{"major":3}}},"created_at":"2016-02-27T09:47:51.091Z","description":"(New in 1.3: theme selection. Light and dark themes available.)\r\n\r\nInspired by classic analog watches, minim embraces the power of Pebble without turning your wrist into a miniature control panel.\r\n\r\nWith Pebble Health enabled, the outer ring doubles as a progress bar for today's steps. Choose your target step count or let minim figure it out from your recent health data. When you complete the circle by reaching your target, the centre pin turns green.\r\n\r\nThe centre pin also provides battery level feedback. It turns red when Pebble's battery reaches 20% or below. (When charging, it flashes red. When fully charged, it flashes green.)\r\n\r\nSpeaking of batteries, you might want to enable \"Battery saving mode\". You'll lose the seconds hand but gain hours of battery life. Decisions, decisions!\r\n\r\n(If you like seconds hands, all is not lost: battery saving mode turns on automatically when you're having a \"deep sleep\".)\r\n\r\nAnd finally, because smart watches should be smart, today's date is never hidden. It moves clockwise as needed to stay clear of the hours and minutes hands.","developer_id":"56d16ffefc2d70c9c5000010","header_images":"","hearts":165,"id":"56d170c73daf465475000011","latest_release":{"id":"56e152ce26f50d6076000003","js_md5":"0c77d34ee56dbd1f381a58cb9e0c1c9a","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/dYdZx1hbQjyy3Vboy44d","published_date":"2016-03-10T10:56:24.166Z","release_notes":"As promised: themes!
