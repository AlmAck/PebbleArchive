I have added a large date number that is easier to read. \r\n\r\nOn the top the a battery status bar is shown if selected in the configuration. It is meant to be only one pixel high to dominate the watchface as little as possible. When the battery reaches 20 percent or less the percent is shown in the lower right corner. \r\n\r\nThe watchface can be configured to inverse when bluetooth connection is lost. If inverse is not selected an icon is shown in the lower left corner when bluetooth is disconnected. It can also vibrate two short pulses on disconnect.","developer_id":"56fd477e6266bfa84f000041","header_images":"","hearts":37,"id":"5736153f9f823cb89300000f","latest_release":{"id":"573b7db89f6e50230400001b","js_md5":"5a7df30d9b27732d52ee068186b39be2","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/2rd9poEcRnCafUP5fLhx","published_date":"2016-05-17T20:24:49.511Z","release_notes":"Fixed critical bug in configuration indexes which made vibrate impossible to turn off.","version":"0.7"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5736153f9f823cb89300000f/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5736153f9f823cb89300000f/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5736153f9f823cb89300000f/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5736153f9f823cb89300000f/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5736153f9f823cb89300000f/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5736153f9f823cb89300000f/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/5736153f9f823cb89300000f"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/75ssNk2QICZwzRFrmGfk/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/75ssNk2QICZwzRFrmGfk/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2016-05-13T18:57:27.099Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/75ssNk2QICZwzRFrmGfk/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"https://github.com/snymainn/minimalist-pebble","title":"Minimalist Analog","type":"watchface","uuid":"0f910221-7ddf-412e-b176-ece076be46f4","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
