My C skills arenâ€™t up to the task. Here is a GitHub link:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/GhastlyJack/minimal-analog\r\n\r\nI had started working on adding color support, color selection, multiple hand options, and a whole bunch of new features. Take and enjoy, make of it what you wish. I do not need to be credited.\r\n\r\n1.3 UPDATE - Added and option to show/hide the battery indicator based on remaining charge.\r\n\r\n1.2 UPDATE - Fixed a small issue in the Javascript API call, no user-side changes.\r\n\r\n1.1 UPDATE - Fixed a space restraint causing the date to truncate. Also moved the condition up a few pixels, it was overlaying the temperature in certain conditions.\r\n\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nA minimalist analog watchface. Includes day/date, auto-locating weather temp and condition, bluetooth notification (when disconnected), battery indicator.\r\n\r\nOptions are available for turning on the seconds hand, Temperature units, and Bluetooth loss vibration.\r\n\r\nAll graphic elements are either code-drawn or presented using a custom icon font, so they are able to be color-selected by the user. Minimalist Analog is compatible with all versions of Pebble, color capabilities are automatically detected.","developer_id":"548e4e233a6cf2363000004d","header_images":"","hearts":100,"id":"552e949996029bc3ed000037","latest_release":{"id":"555654dad237d6f863000025","js_md5":"c9aa917026444702a4d11067e04ce760","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/4BxURAITXiA3D5zjSSlB","published_date":"2015-05-15T20:21:37.478Z","release_notes":"Release 1.3 - Added option for showing or hiding the battery indicator based on percentage.
