However, we get tired very often of those. And they don't suit up very well with ties.\r\n\r\nMinimal One is a simple minimalistic watchface that shows you the information that matters at a glance. It buzzes every o'clock time.\r\n\r\nTime, current day and date are there. Simple, minimal. Quick! \r\n\r\nSupported by: Pebble, Pebble Steel, Pebble Time and Time Steel. Time Round coming soon!\r\n\r\n--New--\r\n-Added support for 12/24hs settings.\r\n\r\n--- Next updates ---\r\n- Choose the colours of the text.\r\n- Choose formatting options for dates (dd/mm, mm/dd, day/dd, etc.).\r\n- Switchable o'clock buzz on/off. \r\n- Choose an optional second time-zone.\r\n- Time Round support.\r\n\r\nThis is my very first watchface, be sure I'll continue updating it. The previous new features are already in pipeline.\r\nI'm on Twitter and email, feedback is much appreciated.","developer_id":"542af6a2dee709ea5400011c","header_images":"","hearts":4,"id":"561d3d7a4af08fc612000091","latest_release":{"id":"561dd510f7d955fa3100002f","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/xYDVVDSXQRCGd7Tq6RJJ","published_date":"2015-10-14T04:08:37.400Z","release_notes":"V1.1:\r\n\r\nFirst release version, with little bugs correction and support for original Pebble and Pebble Time.","version":"1.0"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/561d3d7a4af08fc612000091/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/561d3d7a4af08fc612000091/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/561d3d7a4af08fc612000091/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/561d3d7a4af08fc612000091/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/561d3d7a4af08fc612000091/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/561d3d7a4af08fc612000091/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/561d3d7a4af08fc612000091"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/18cvJM7GQqmjBUcgOGi6/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/18cvJM7GQqmjBUcgOGi6/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-10-14T13:13:50.212Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/18cvJM7GQqmjBUcgOGi6/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"Minimal One","type":"watchface","uuid":"a6828a58-6a18-46f4-a1f5-3ad0339176cb","website":"https://twitter.com/airiefenix"}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
