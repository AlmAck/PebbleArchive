It's completely free, which means no limitations and no hidden subscription fees! No companion app required. ANDROID ONLY*\r\n\r\nWorks great on bike and on foot and is very efficient, so both your phone's and your Pebble's battery gets drained as little as possible.\r\n\r\nMap tiles are generously provided for free by CartoDB (cartodb.com) and Stamen Design (stamen.com). The tiles are downloaded as needed, which means you need an internet connection to use this app.\r\n\r\nControls:\r\nUP - zoom in\r\nSELECT - refresh\r\nDOWN - zoom out\r\n\r\n*unfortunately, iOS host doesn't provide HTML5 Canvas, which is used for rendering the map without a companion app\r\n\r\nWhy no colors? I don't have a color Pebble. If you can get me a Pebble Time (round), I'll develop a color version for free ;)","developer_id":"554cc4a57bf325e5e8000046","header_images":[{"orig":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/Ygw7PrrORIuLt879S3Cg/convert?cache=true&fit=crop","720x320":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/Ygw7PrrORIuLt879S3Cg/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=720&h=320"}],"hearts":197,"icon_image":{"28x28":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/eqCtLwxGQmCSAj38Tyzk/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=28&h=28","48x48":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/eqCtLwxGQmCSAj38Tyzk/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=48&h=48"},"id":"57d15955a789e1b1b4000280","latest_release":{"id":"5810683fd0050256d50000a2","js_md5":"611014908c4bd724849d6f95f209e2f0","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/3pPxKLi9RXSrv9DSe6HA","published_date":"2016-10-26T08:25:59.281Z","release_notes":"Improved compatibility with older versions of Android (< 5.0)","version":"1.2"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57d15955a789e1b1b4000280/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57d15955a789e1b1b4000280/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57d15955a789e1b1b4000280/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57d15955a789e1b1b4000280/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57d15955a789e1b1b4000280/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57d15955a789e1b1b4000280/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/57d15955a789e1b1b4000280"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/YqFFnxwyS2KAQbDe2DJ9/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/YqFFnxwyS2KAQbDe2DJ9/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2016-09-08T15:43:31.762Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/er5AFeFpTuu2N2Iw8zYl/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/HdqCt71mRCGx9GJi4Pop/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"Mini Map","type":"watchapp","uuid":"1f86ad16-dd8c-4208-8507-c5b2a621a667","website":"http://blade.sk/"}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
