It couldn't be simpler. \r\nTo control a Mac's audio, long-select on a connected Mac. You'll see an audio control screen, with information about the currently playing track. Long-select again on audio controls to swap between track and volume controls.\r\nTo speed up unlocking even further, if a Mac wakes as you walk up to it using Proximity Wake (enabled in MacID for OS X) while MacID for Pebble is active, you'll get a handy unlock notification in the app. From there you can choose to unlock or snooze requests for an hour, just like MacID for iOS and MacID for Pebble.\r\n\r\nGot feedback? Let me know at @MacIDHelp on Twitter."}],"companions":{"ios":{"id":"567414a7a817158b3900001c","icon":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/t20JtE5qRMiNwNYR2VQu","name":"MacID for iOS","url":"http://appstore.com/macid","required":true,"pebblekit_version":"3"},"android":null},"compatibility":{"ios":{"supported":true,"min_js_version":-1},"android":{"supported":false},"aplite":{"supported":true,"firmware":{"major":3}},"basalt":{"supported":true,"firmware":{"major":3}},"chalk":{"supported":true,"firmware":{"major":3}},"diorite":{"supported":true,"firmware":{"major":3}},"emery":{"supported":true,"firmware":{"major":3}}},"created_at":"2015-12-10T19:39:50.268Z","description":"MacID for Pebble is here.
