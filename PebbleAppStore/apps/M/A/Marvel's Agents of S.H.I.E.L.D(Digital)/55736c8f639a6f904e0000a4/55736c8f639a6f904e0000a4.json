Counting the SHIELD theme, we have a B/W digital watch face. I wanted to do something for Pebble Time, but SHIELD looks best in Black/White. Enjoy! Look out for my Avengers and Hydra watch faces.\r\n___\r\nCreated with watchfacegenerator.de/v3 The purpose of these watch faces is not to steal from Paul Rode, creator of watch face generator, but to provide generated watch faces for popular books, movies, tv shows, video games that are easy to redownload on the store and stay in your App Locker. By all means, check the site out and create some of your own.
