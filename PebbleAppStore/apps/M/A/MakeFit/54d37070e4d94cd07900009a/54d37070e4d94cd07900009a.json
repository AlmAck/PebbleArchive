MakeFit is a quantified fitness tracking app that helps you track fitness improvements and keep yourself fit over time.\r\n\r\nKnow how workouts and activities compare in effort, how your fitness evolves over time as a result of your efforts and if your current fatigue is increasing, decreasing or maintaining your fitness level.\r\n\r\nMakeFit is the only mobile app that gives you a personal analysis of your sports and movement efforts using data from MotionTracking (Apple M7 & M8) and Bluetooth HR monitors. Also, with Pebble watch app you can now easily track live your workout activity.\r\n\r\nThe current version of MakeFit works on iPhone 5s or newer. We're working on an update to include support for older devices as well though HealthKit.\r\n","developer_id":"52f77cf1cbdf71b42100021d","header_images":[{"orig":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/DIyG3KLoS66Zgh0g7XTv/convert?cache=true&fit=crop","720x320":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/DIyG3KLoS66Zgh0g7XTv/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=720&h=320"},{"orig":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/KozB19JTQ6ec3o3y2gxq/convert?cache=true&fit=crop","720x320":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/KozB19JTQ6ec3o3y2gxq/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=720&h=320"}],"hearts":161,"icon_image":{"28x28":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/ulMUYGFwSSdC42Qn4mar/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=28&h=28","48x48":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/ulMUYGFwSSdC42Qn4mar/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=48&h=48"},"id":"54d37070e4d94cd07900009a","latest_release":{"id":"54d3951862e29b65500000d7","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/NQKbm35ASYa5FVck17DW","published_date":"2015-03-23T18:39:24.902Z","release_notes":"The latest version of the iOS companion app including all the features needed for the Pebble app is currently pending approval from Apple.\r\n\r\nThe current MakeFit app in the Apple AppStore is compatible with the Pebble app, but is not sending some of the information needed by the Pebble App for complete functionality.","version":"1.0"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54d37070e4d94cd07900009a/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54d37070e4d94cd07900009a/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54d37070e4d94cd07900009a/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54d37070e4d94cd07900009a/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54d37070e4d94cd07900009a/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54d37070e4d94cd07900009a/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/54d37070e4d94cd07900009a"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/dPWyZc77SmquF28jkdvD/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/dPWyZc77SmquF28jkdvD/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-03-23T18:39:29.558Z","screenshot_hardware":"aplite","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/NRNultFuQTuotfUgi7OP/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/rU3fFfDsR7ytPxXumlei/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/f3nui3KS8OfXf3NhDmbf/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"MakeFit","type":"watchapp","uuid":"6791e8bd-7bc5-46cf-b3f6-8f601b6c1ebe","website":"http://www.makef.it"}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
