We couldn't forget the loyal Hydra double agents(cough cough Ward :P). A BW can be found at the source link, but it doesn't look good enough to publish, but try it if you want. Created with watchfacegenerator by paul rode. \r\n\r\nIn Season 1, Ward would love the pebble. He would have his Hydra watch face ready for when he needed to switch. \r\n Enjoy! Look out for my Avengers, Star Trek and Star Wars watch faces.\r\n\r\n ___ \r\nCreated with watchfacegenerator.de/v3 The purpose of these watch faces is not to steal from Paul Rode, creator of watch face generator, but to provide generated watch faces for popular books, movies, tv shows, video games that are easy to redownload on the store and stay in your App Locker. By all means, check the site out and create some of your own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","developer_id":"52f37c4cc1347196a2000003","header_images":"","hearts":20,"id":"557375343b1d512634000097","latest_release":{"id":"557377027d6f3d3d230000ad","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/t12VbuS8ShCRpU0L2rSW","published_date":"2015-06-06T22:41:38.509Z","release_notes":"","version":"1.0"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/557375343b1d512634000097/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/557375343b1d512634000097/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/557375343b1d512634000097/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/557375343b1d512634000097/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/557375343b1d512634000097/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/557375343b1d512634000097/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/557375343b1d512634000097"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/4mZajukJRLGsrbUdDASO/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/4mZajukJRLGsrbUdDASO/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-06-06T22:42:05.316Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/4mZajukJRLGsrbUdDASO/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"http://www.watchface-generator.de/wf/v3/20150607/hydra_watchface/","title":"Marvel's Agents of SHIELD: Hail Hydra","type":"watchface","uuid":"13371337-d8b0-4a80-af51-73a776fb43ff","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
