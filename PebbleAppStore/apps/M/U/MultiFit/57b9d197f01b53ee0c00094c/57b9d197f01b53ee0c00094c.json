Automatically detects standing/sitting, walking and running. Each activity has its own watchface.\r\n\r\nSitting: an elegant watchface with all the required items (time, date, the weather, battery for watch & Android phone, your daily progress)\r\n\r\nWalking: same information, but the step count and your daily progress are more visible\r\n\r\nRunning: watchface turns into a fitness watch - shows the duration of the run, the distance and the pace (min/km or min/mi). Will support heart sensor on P2 and T2.\r\n\r\nWhen you stop running, the watch will continue to show your run for a minute. If you start to run again during this minute, the run will resume. The watchface doesn't need your phone for GPS while running. It gets information from the watch.","developer_id":"546bbedb71d611761800000f","header_images":"","hearts":252,"id":"57b9d197f01b53ee0c00094c","latest_release":{"id":"580648b39392fff61f0000a3","js_md5":"c3616410e9f95a65f7c8dd480d1b48d2","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/2gUdk5yARMmnlwmV1whU","published_date":"2016-10-18T16:07:31.339Z","release_notes":"distance fix","version":"1.42"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57b9d197f01b53ee0c00094c/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57b9d197f01b53ee0c00094c/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57b9d197f01b53ee0c00094c/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57b9d197f01b53ee0c00094c/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57b9d197f01b53ee0c00094c/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57b9d197f01b53ee0c00094c/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/57b9d197f01b53ee0c00094c"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/7UW8pr4S3K1gl0aMO763/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/7UW8pr4S3K1gl0aMO763/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2016-08-21T19:12:02.685Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/7UW8pr4S3K1gl0aMO763/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/qcpCiviRS6GVRfIiCCcB/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/P56saoNRTYuvRFwNRfEY/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/0V6suV0R5GDnmvwVXorb/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/B1kWdnIyTgSK9hLkiwXH/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"MultiFit","type":"watchface","uuid":"55a0052d-7761-4c9d-b457-0cfbbe8bc4fc","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
