Shows you progress of your daily totals compared to your goal for the day. Shows Calories and the first three other nutrients tracked in your diary settings. Buttons move backward and forward through the calendar so you can compare previous days.\r\n\r\nFood diary must be set to public for Pebble to gain access to your information. No password is required.\r\n\r\nIf you like the app, please heart it in the app store. If you don't like it or would like to see additional features, please let me know and I will see what I can do. Remember, I can only read from your public diary. I cannot write to it.\r\n\r\nWe are not affiliated with or endorsed by MyFitnessPal or Under Armour.","developer_id":"5650a7c7331881d9120000af","header_images":[{"orig":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/FYZJjC9HREqAi8mYBgYo/convert?cache=true&fit=crop","720x320":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/FYZJjC9HREqAi8mYBgYo/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=720&h=320"}],"hearts":100,"icon_image":{"28x28":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/Om3Q6a4T3ux2Pe0FmOhR/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=28&h=28","48x48":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/Om3Q6a4T3ux2Pe0FmOhR/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=48&h=48"},"id":"5761961f98c4dbbe5f000007","latest_release":{"id":"578520e36c21040179000831","js_md5":"21242e303afdc80df3c89d1cf6211272","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/9vaV7rV0RiSSc3INxKK8","published_date":"2016-07-12T16:55:23.662Z","release_notes":"Update to accommodate changes to MyFitnessPal's public diary page.","version":"1.1"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5761961f98c4dbbe5f000007/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5761961f98c4dbbe5f000007/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5761961f98c4dbbe5f000007/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5761961f98c4dbbe5f000007/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5761961f98c4dbbe5f000007/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5761961f98c4dbbe5f000007/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/5761961f98c4dbbe5f000007"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/DF4hcYeSTCGKAVRmLNzQ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/DF4hcYeSTCGKAVRmLNzQ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2016-06-15T22:39:57.025Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/v7HZAoTrTfSyYnptISPy/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/KTICzFc4SqU1uLGeTRog/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/FHfaf73vQoy8xpx0Q8rF/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/zB27PkAwSAuVimTd0KeV/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"MyFitnessPal Daily Stats","type":"watchapp","uuid":"934e6931-ab69-4727-9486-8cc3530879b8","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
