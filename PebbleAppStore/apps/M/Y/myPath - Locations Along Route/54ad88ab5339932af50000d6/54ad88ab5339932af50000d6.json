Just select what you're looking for and and let myPath - Locations Along Route find it for you.\r\n\r\nHate when your navigation system has you turn around or go off your route to get to a stop along your trip? Never again will you needlessly waste time doubling back when trying to make a quick stop on a trip. The myPath app utilizes location technology to detect your route direction, and shows you matching locations ahead along your route based off your search keywords.\r\n\r\nFor example, say you're traveling north on I-95. myPath will only show you locations north of you along the route you're traveling, ensuring all results won't have you turning around and wasting time to reach them. And once you've found what you're looking for, simply tap on the location search result to get address information.\r\n\r\nmyPath lets you save time and hassle on your car trip. Only deal with locations along your route ahead of you with myPath.\r\n\r\nFull Android application:\r\nhttp://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=myPathLite.app&hl=en\r\n\r\nDonations to PayPal email: zach.butler0928@gmail.com","developer_id":"549c85ff45afee67830005e5","header_images":[{"orig":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/uCNu4v74TluiTSrGPWWU/convert?cache=true&fit=crop","720x320":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/uCNu4v74TluiTSrGPWWU/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=720&h=320"}],"hearts":14,"icon_image":{"28x28":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/G11HlK2cTMqTdBlYo9Lw/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=28&h=28","48x48":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/G11HlK2cTMqTdBlYo9Lw/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=48&h=48"},"id":"54ad88ab5339932af50000d6","latest_release":{"id":"54af6d06413f38e0f800003a","js_md5":"7839d42fafe6f048813f294cfcdf31dc","js_version":25,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/6OyZvZQlSpeIMeXWWo3i","published_date":"2015-01-09T05:54:29.269Z","release_notes":"v2: Faster with better user interaction and more accurate results","version":"2.0"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54ad88ab5339932af50000d6/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54ad88ab5339932af50000d6/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54ad88ab5339932af50000d6/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54ad88ab5339932af50000d6/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54ad88ab5339932af50000d6/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54ad88ab5339932af50000d6/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/54ad88ab5339932af50000d6"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/xWH5G1pHTsScN82Ox3Zq/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/xWH5G1pHTsScN82Ox3Zq/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-01-09T05:54:32.058Z","screenshot_hardware":"aplite","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/cE5o18JjRTeiy0diGVcO/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/U2imi1tJRMGQhZkQn1Fe/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/USZF341KTB6CsZix5aiA/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"myPath - Locations Along Route","type":"watchapp","uuid":"1edb92f0-1ad9-4df6-a873-dbc4a4f6de3c","website":"http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=myPathLite.app&hl=en"}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
