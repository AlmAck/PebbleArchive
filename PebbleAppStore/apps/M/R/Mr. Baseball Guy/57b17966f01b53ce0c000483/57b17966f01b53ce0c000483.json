Features include:\r\n\r\n* (New feature) You can now add your favorite teams to your Timeline! If you choose to do this, you will also receive an alert when the game starts and a notification when it ends. Powered by Raspberry Pi.\r\n\r\n* View all the current game's plays by holding the up button. Batteries not included.\r\n\r\n* Automatic and manual refresh (hold select), so you can vigorously watch your game's score as you vigorously ignore class and work.\r\n\r\n* A date selector, so you can go back to a time when your team was actually relevant.\r\n\r\n* A color display (Time devices only).\r\n\r\n* Up to 3 favorite teams, so you can watch your team win. Or, if you're a fan of my team, see a daily reminder of how much the other team can score.\r\n\r\n* Matchup and game details, as well as the last play -- more plays coming*.\r\n\r\n* The option to vibrate on score change.\r\n\r\n* A clock (patent pending).\r\n\r\n*More features are coming soon, like Timeline support, more plays, and possibly in-game box scores.\r\n\r\nThis is the initial release, so there are still probably some bugs. Just let me know when you find one!\r\nSee what our best users (read: me) have to say:\r\n\r\n\"Genuinely good.\"\r\n-- Ethan B.\r\n\r\n\"A real heartwarming love story.\"\r\n-- E.
