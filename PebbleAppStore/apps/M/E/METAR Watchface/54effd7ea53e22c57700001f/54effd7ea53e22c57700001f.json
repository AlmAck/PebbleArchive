This open-source watchface organizes and displays the METAR report for your favorite or nearest airport. Unlike some watchfaces which only display the raw text, we make sense of the data. This allows us to better arrange your report and even determine the current Flight Rules.\r\n\r\nKnow immediately when your favorite airport is under VFR, MVFR, IFR, or LIFR.\r\n\r\nHeader: Local time (12 or 24), ICAO station ID, Flight rules\r\nRow1:  Current Zulu time, Issue time, Minutes since issued\r\nRow2:  Wind direction, Wind speed including gusts (KT/MPS)\r\nRow3:  Temperature (C), Dewpoint (C), Altimeter (InHg/hPa)\r\nRow4:  Visibility (SM/km), Other WX Codes (ex: -SN, NOSIG)\r\nRow5:  Bottom two cloud layers (ex: OVC020)\r\n\r\nBackground behind \"minutes since issue\" will be red if the last fetch was not successful.\r\n\r\nUpdated 2016-10-31:\r\nNew AVWX endpoint, new menu icons\r\n\r\nNote: METARs come in two variants: International and North American. Both variants use different units for visibility and altimeter. While the altimeter value is easy to tell apart, visibility is not. Though the unit is not displayed on screen, an altimeter around 1000 will always have vis reported by km, and an altimeter around 29.92 will always have vis reported by SM. Some stations report wind speed in MPS rather than KT, but these units will always be displayed on screen.","developer_id":"54b1357d1af59f571c00008d","header_images":"","hearts":84,"id":"54effd7ea53e22c57700001f","latest_release":{"id":"58182a87c68d005a4500002a","js_md5":"638f7734962dcf64e3324cbb15954ca1","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/hGsdc0SuQbGGZBDJWD8g","published_date":"2016-11-01T05:39:48.409Z","release_notes":"New AVWX endpoint\r\nNew menu icons","version":"3.7"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54effd7ea53e22c57700001f/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54effd7ea53e22c57700001f/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54effd7ea53e22c57700001f/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54effd7ea53e22c57700001f/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54effd7ea53e22c57700001f/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54effd7ea53e22c57700001f/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/54effd7ea53e22c57700001f"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/rKW7wvBySfaurgAYAEHR/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/rKW7wvBySfaurgAYAEHR/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-02-27T05:21:55.520Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/rKW7wvBySfaurgAYAEHR/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/QmNrgKQl20DtiGS6Y4Nw/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/42Ky5hHVROOWA8HdXGFZ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"https://github.com/flyinactor91/METAR-Watchface","title":"METAR Watchface","type":"watchface","uuid":"7a57a498-fc22-4f07-a05c-4e67cf34fbb0","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
