A flick of the wrist reveals the date, and the tile color can be customized. Text color can be inverted within two seconds of launching the watchface by a wrist flick.\r\n\r\nFeel free to like this watchface. Like, I mean you /can/ like it if you'd likeâ€”what I'm trying to say is that you don't have to absolutely hate this watchface like usual. I'm leaving your feelings up to you.","developer_id":"52f033041ac794fac8000aae","header_images":"","hearts":420,"id":"56005838421a4405ad000090","latest_release":{"id":"560b1c16bc20afdcdd000027","js_md5":"3da2c033a400be879d1cf5b62adfed91","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/8ULdTqXHThmLyW8USAu1","published_date":"2015-09-29T23:17:56.926Z","release_notes":"Added ability to invert text color by flicking wrist within first two seconds of launching the watchface.","version":"1.4"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56005838421a4405ad000090/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56005838421a4405ad000090/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56005838421a4405ad000090/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56005838421a4405ad000090/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56005838421a4405ad000090/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56005838421a4405ad000090/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/56005838421a4405ad000090"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/qlUUL24aTBK7Q8wquV29/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/qlUUL24aTBK7Q8wquV29/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-09-21T19:51:45.787Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/qlUUL24aTBK7Q8wquV29/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"Metro Flip","type":"watchface","uuid":"967f5f35-354e-43fd-a376-97d2adf3174c","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
