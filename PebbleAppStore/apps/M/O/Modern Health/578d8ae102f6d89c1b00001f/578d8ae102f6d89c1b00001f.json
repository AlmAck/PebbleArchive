You can purchase this face individually for $0.99 or purchase our entire collection of 20+ faces for $5.99. You can purchase within the settings page.\r\n\r\nIf you love our faces, give us a heart to let us know!\r\n\r\nModern Health was designed and built for simplicity and clarity. We focused on adding clear fonts but also giving your status of your daily step goal. The outer bar can be your battery or your progress towards your customized step goal. The step goal can be your daily average or a set amount (10k steps). You can also customize the fonts to be thick or thin. And of course with all Kiezel Faces, you can customize all the colors to your liking.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nTeam Kiezel-","developer_id":"558e3fd4e3975e527b000055","header_images":"","hearts":160,"id":"578d8ae102f6d89c1b00001f","latest_release":{"id":"578e4b2902f6d87d0f0000a0","js_md5":"9c8dade16a9a35bfec1e18b712fcb21c","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/TZFizNW2QCsVToOL40mC","published_date":"2016-07-19T15:45:59.706Z","release_notes":"","version":"1.0"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/578d8ae102f6d89c1b00001f/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/578d8ae102f6d89c1b00001f/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/578d8ae102f6d89c1b00001f/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/578d8ae102f6d89c1b00001f/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/578d8ae102f6d89c1b00001f/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/578d8ae102f6d89c1b00001f/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/578d8ae102f6d89c1b00001f"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/9GKmJxiMSg2GjXB2SJC2/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/9GKmJxiMSg2GjXB2SJC2/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2016-07-19T17:29:38.299Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/9GKmJxiMSg2GjXB2SJC2/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/wKBPSYn6SsCXS1BqiVt6/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/Blct37DUQNWBKAzxP0Qw/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/N1fCUk0hRvCtCsBGPWrB/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/c221cRaQSPy2oKXgOOHa/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"Modern Health","type":"watchface","uuid":"e8bd327d-5f59-4e6c-9eaf-73a1a05e406c","website":"https://www.kiezelwatchfaces.com"}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
