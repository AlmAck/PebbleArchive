Shows your daily goal, steps counter and inactive minutes. \r\nTop activity bar will be filled in an hour of inactivity and will vibrate every 15 minutes until you get up and walk for a couple of minutes. \r\nThe smiling face indicates your long-term statistics of your daily goal achievement. More than 80% makes it happy and less than 40% not.\r\nDaily goal, starting from 8.25K steps, will increase 5% when you achieve it or get 5% less otherwise.\r\nStep counting is quite accurate (well, at least in tracking walking steps :), but sometimes it fails to count real steps. Steady pace walking gives almost 100% accuracy, but a 30-min drive can count about 30-100 extra steps.\r\nThere's an issue with horizontal movement (ellipse trainer, for example) that counts almost no steps.\r\n","developer_id":"55890dd0133ae7f1250000a5","header_images":"","hearts":56,"id":"559a4261393bdf202d00000c","latest_release":{"id":"56bb3e49101f05e16900000e","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/vgcL1ZIYSKatEpPSSTl6","published_date":"2016-02-12T07:04:12.252Z","release_notes":"Changed the step-counting algorithm - now it is simpler and faster;\r\nImproved sleep detection (not for sleep recording, but not to disturb at night);\r\nChanged the buzz pattern to be much shorter;\r\nMade it easier to get a happy face;","version":"0.3"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/559a4261393bdf202d00000c/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/559a4261393bdf202d00000c/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/559a4261393bdf202d00000c/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/559a4261393bdf202d00000c/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/559a4261393bdf202d00000c/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/559a4261393bdf202d00000c/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/559a4261393bdf202d00000c"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/tbAL8vl2STWtiGKlonQe/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/tbAL8vl2STWtiGKlonQe/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-07-10T11:03:52.877Z","screenshot_hardware":"aplite","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/tbAL8vl2STWtiGKlonQe/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"http://www.github.com/sergem56/PebbleMoveIt","title":"MoveIt!","type":"watchface","uuid":"0383cdf0-78a1-4d54-b49d-73749c3c7c62","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
