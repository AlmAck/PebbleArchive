The hour hand is represented by a triangle. Midnight is on bottom of the watchface while Noon is indicated on top. One rotation of the hour hand takes a whole day.\r\n\r\nOn Accelerometer Event of the watch more detailed time information is displayed for a specific while. On timeout the display toggles back to normal view.\r\n\r\nIf holding the Pebble watch parallel over ground and turning it so the hour hand is pointing towards the sun then top of the watch face will always point in south direction and bottom of watch face in north direction on northern hemisphere (Compass feature).\r\n\r\nMind the difference of southern hemisphere and northern hemisphere: On southern hemisphere top of the watch face will indicate north direction while bottom of watch face is oriented south.\r\n\r\nThe current Moon phase is shown for northern hemisphere. Moon phase display is expected to work until end of Unix Time (overflow on Jan 19th, 2038 03:14:07 GMT) at least as implemented here. For simplicity the axis of the Moon is shown vertically on the watch face only.\r\n","developer_id":"55592fc6b038d44f9e00003e","header_images":"","hearts":48,"id":"558c86d9a2deec56ce00001a","latest_release":{"id":"56f6cbece58879a7bc00000f","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/e7nVg4tySPMBkxlCWrhF","published_date":"2016-03-26T17:50:53.821Z","release_notes":"","version":"1.3"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/558c86d9a2deec56ce00001a/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/558c86d9a2deec56ce00001a/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/558c86d9a2deec56ce00001a/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/558c86d9a2deec56ce00001a/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/558c86d9a2deec56ce00001a/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/558c86d9a2deec56ce00001a/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/558c86d9a2deec56ce00001a"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/ZEIp9dOHTpmaGCPW9bFq/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/ZEIp9dOHTpmaGCPW9bFq/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-06-25T23:09:46.336Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/ZEIp9dOHTpmaGCPW9bFq/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/dpuRxVM0QIajEkYhXrNM/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"https://github.com/OMerkel/pebble-samples","title":"Moon for Northern Hemisphere","type":"watchface","uuid":"7615efae-aef6-4958-97fa-524e97f232b9","website":"https://github.com/OMerkel/pebble-samples"}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
