The reasoning being that it is likely that another menu item will be picked after these ones. Use cases like set smart alarm times, then pick bed time. Or set times and store in preset memory.\r\n* All watch face times now pay correct attention to 12hr or 24hr setting.\r\n* The date on the tops of menus and the main screen includes the day of the week. Personally I really care this is Friday night....\r\n* The IFTTT Maker interface now gets a 'morpheuz_bedtime' event too.\r\n* The app starts faster on Pebble and Pebble Steel.\r\n* Little notices to tell you to press \"Bed time\" don't appear whilst you are on the menu trying to press the \"Bed time\" option. This seemed rude.\r\n* The times for the smart alarm can straddle midnight.\r\n* A typo showing hyphens on the IFTTT maker events on the settings page has been fixed. Should be underscores.\r\n* Alarm button markers appear when the alarm sounds. No more guessing which button to press.\r\n\r\nMenu checkboxes are ticked or empty on b&w devices - makes it extra clear whether something is on. The red crosses and green ticks remain on the colour devices.\r\nThe auto bedtime now shows the time as 12/24 hour as selected.\r\nRemoved ‘weekend mode’. Removing functionality is something I very seldom ever do. I added this feature back in the days when the alarm was turned on and off from the phone at the same time as reset for bed was picked. It allowed 12 hours of ‘don’t bother with the alarm’ to be selected from the watch. However now the alarm can be turned on and off so easily with the pick of a menu item, it is simply confusing (the alarm is on, there are times shown on the screen, but the alarm is off right?). The only email correspondence I ever had on the feature expressed mild bemusement. There was even a message that was displayed if someone attempted to set weekend mode when the alarm was off."},{"version":"3.4","published_date":"2015-09-12T12:55:40.741Z","release_notes":"Collapsing config sections on setting page. They are all shown initially collapsed to reduce the overall cluttered appearance.\r\n* IFTTT Maker Channel support with 'morpheuz_data' and 'morpheuz_alarm' events.\r\n* Record icon appears immediately 'bed time' is selected, rather than appearing, somewhat confusingly, after a minute.\r\n* All the config sections have bullet point colours to correctly reflect the set status: grey (one-off export), blue (automatic but unset), green (automatic and set) and red (automatic and failed).\r\n* Ensure that LIFX fadein time defaults to a reasonable 60 seconds.\r\n* Automatically open the config sections on those exports/interfaces that have failed so as the reason why is shown immediately.\r\n* Bug in menu introduced in 3.3 removed."},{"version":"3.3","published_date":"2015-08-22T21:39:14.472Z","release_notes":"No background process. Morpheuz can now work happily with UP or Misfit. When these interrupt Morpheuz in order to sync their data, Morpheuz will, if it it monitoring sleep re-launch itself after 5 minutes. Morpheuz can easily co-exist with either of these or Battery+.\r\nPhillips Hue light triggering on alarm. If the specified light is off, then it comes on at minimum brightness and brightens gently to maximum. If the light is already on Morpheuz leaves it unchanged.\r\nRedesigned analogue face which is much easier to read. \r\nBattery bar goes orange and then red on low battery (Pebble Time).\r\nBetter version propagation (again).\r\nLIFX Smartbulb handling should now work correctly.\r\nMenu shows action just before closing, providing a more solid positive feedback.\r\nHighlight color of menu and settings now black on Pebble Time. This provides more contrast and makes it easier to see and read.\r\nRemoved additional jqplot header from HTML - minor but probably unnoticeable performance improvement.\r\nIncluded a chart hyperlink in the CSV export. Now see the chart again as well as read a copy of your data\r\nIgnore line on plot now matches width of chart so appears to cover 10 minutes as it should.\r\nProvided a \"Test pushover/smartlight settings\" checkbox on save on the configuration page. Makes it possible to test without waiting until morning.\r\nThe horizontal marks on the movement chart are now at the threshold between deep, light and restless sleep."},{"version":"3.2","published_date":"2015-07-11T11:25:29.482Z","release_notes":"* Better graphics on Pebble Time\r\n* Preset smart alarm times (3 independent memories) (sadly PT only due to application size)\r\n* Battery gauge goes red when 10% or less power available (PT)\r\n* Email export of CSV data now sends a pleasantly formatted HTML email rather than using \"mailto:\" which worked on iOS but seldom on Android. It takes a few seconds for confirmation on screen.\r\n* Removed CSV copy area as the email export should now be usable on all platforms.\r\n* Cancel alarm and snooze alarm now match the built in alarm button choices regardless of platform (PT has cancel on down and snooze on up - original pebble is visa-versa).\r\n* The \"notices\" window can be cancelled by the press of any button.\r\n* The 11 hour after bedtime wakeup for automatic exports shuts down as soon as they are done rather than leaving Morpheuz open for 5 minutes.\r\n* The long press on the back button to leave Morpheuz (originally intended to prevent an accidental press stopping the app) is now only required when in \"recording\" mode or when power nap is running. Any other time a single press will shut the app, just like any other."},{"version":"3.1","published_date":"2015-06-06T12:14:47.877Z","release_notes":"* Timeline with actions and quote of the day\r\n* 10 hours recording\r\n* LIFX light support\r\n* Colour graph on Pebble Time on main screen\r\n* Strap metrics replaced\r\n* Some nomenclature changes - Reset is now 'Bed time'"},{"version":"3.0","published_date":"2015-05-09T13:45:06.754Z","release_notes":"Fixed timezone handling under Basalt (Pebble Time)"},{"version":"2.9","published_date":"2015-05-06T21:42:15.665Z","release_notes":"* Color and 3.0 support"},{"version":"2.8","published_date":"2015-01-11T21:33:30.112Z","release_notes":"* Version warning in settings page\r\n* Copyright upgraded to 2015\r\n* Full C to JS round trip app message ACK\r\n* Better version number propogation\r\n* Allow working builds without the file containing usage application key\r\n* No longer stops the worker process on exit as this wrecked upgrades\r\n* Settings page scales to size of phone\r\n* Report view in pushover scales to size of phone and supports landscape"},{"version":"2.7","published_date":"2015-01-11T21:32:12.092Z","release_notes":"Improved icons;
