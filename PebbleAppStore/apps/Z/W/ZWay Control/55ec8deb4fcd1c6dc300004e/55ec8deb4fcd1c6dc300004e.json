It should still work fine though!\r\n\r\nControl your Z-Wave light switches from your wrist! This unofficial app integrates with your Raspberry Pi-based Z-Way system.\r\n\r\nCurrently this app only supports on/off switches, more support to come in the future. Please be sure to run Settings - a username/password can be set via http://<raspberry-pi ip-address>:8084/ if you haven't already.\r\n\r\nThis app requires a Raspberry-Pi based ZWay system (http://www.z-wave.me/) to function, and also requires your phone be on the same local network as your Z-Wave system. Not compatible with other ZWave systems such as Vera.\r\n\r\nQuestions or feedback welcome: pebble@radicand.org\r\n\r\nContribute to the app at: https://github.com/radicand/PebbleZWay","developer_id":"55079df5febe68ca0b0000a2","header_images":[{"orig":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/1q8Xw4AuQwWu2i3Bqcrw/convert?cache=true&fit=crop","720x320":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/1q8Xw4AuQwWu2i3Bqcrw/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=720&h=320"}],"hearts":12,"icon_image":{"28x28":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/E2ECfjORgCN81fVTCRUs/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=28&h=28","48x48":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/E2ECfjORgCN81fVTCRUs/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=48&h=48"},"id":"55ec8deb4fcd1c6dc300004e","latest_release":{"id":"5606a9744e83a2f5bc000050","js_md5":"0773058192aa2ad14422841bf1c98d6f","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/Liq0Kb9cTl6vVup8C7gn","published_date":"2015-09-26T14:28:31.350Z","release_notes":"Fixed compatibility with Pebble Classic that prevented logging into the Pi","version":"1.2"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55ec8deb4fcd1c6dc300004e/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55ec8deb4fcd1c6dc300004e/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55ec8deb4fcd1c6dc300004e/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55ec8deb4fcd1c6dc300004e/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55ec8deb4fcd1c6dc300004e/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55ec8deb4fcd1c6dc300004e/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/55ec8deb4fcd1c6dc300004e"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/IoADFVMjSYyLPBP3U5kJ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/IoADFVMjSYyLPBP3U5kJ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-09-06T19:17:17.630Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/Jf3iDcnRRNW4H6JUXpft/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/hc15jpehT0D2GlztJLlQ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"https://github.com/radicand/PebbleZWay","title":"ZWay Control","type":"watchapp","uuid":"5b7e0479-717c-4480-b3c5-193a68addead","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
