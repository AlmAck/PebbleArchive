Supports english, french, german and spanish.\r\n\r\nWeather is taken from your phone's location by default, or can be manually configured by city name and country code (in case you've denied access to location service). Uses weather forecasts up to 24 hours when your Pebble is running without bluetooth.\r\n\r\nYou can choose between a lot of temperature units in configurations dialog: Fahrenheit, Celsius, Delisle, Kelvin, Newton, Rankine, Réaumur, Rømer.\r\n\r\nWhile watch-wearer is sleeping (detected by \"Pebble Health\"), watchface is automatically switched-off to save energy.\r\n\r\nThe second hand is hidden by default. Shake your wrist to show it for a few seconds. You can configure the second hand to be permanently visible, but this will drain your Pebble's battery more quickly.\r\n\r\nYou can configure \"No date\" watchface complication, or \"Date only\", or \"Weekday and date\" (only on Time Round) in the configurations dialog.\r\n\r\nThe estimated remaining battery hours can optionally be displayed. And there is a battery meter painted in green, yellow or red colors (depending on the Pebble's battery level) between the minute markers at the bottom of the watchface. I find this a pretty cool feature. :)\r\n\r\nThere is a bluetooth icon appearing and double-vibrating when bluetooth connection with phone has been lost.\r\n\r\nAnd there is more to come! BTW: If you love this watchface as much as I do, please give it a <3. Thx.","developer_id":"556aa44fda4c41832f0000a7","header_images":"","hearts":70,"id":"5745eb0f4b70684146000013","latest_release":{"id":"582d67a936ac5a54330003c0","js_md5":"e927b4f7b538d2295a2fe4540ccf92e1","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/NrpDG2y2SvSpS4lHmZbK","published_date":"2016-11-17T08:19:59.422Z","release_notes":"It's cold outside.
