This is the time before the race starts. Fx when race director says\" 5 seconds to start!\".\r\n- Race timer. This is the main race timer.\r\n- After race timer. This tells you how long time has elapsed since the race timer expired.\r\nEach timer can be configured and vibration interval can also be set. Fx vibrate for each 1 min.\r\nEnd of Race vibration can also be set to different patterns.\r\nAt some races mains are running longer that qualification, so it is possible to store up to settings in a profile. 5 profiles are available. Profiles can easily be selected from the main screen.","developer_id":"5534a4caa752a16b9400009b","header_images":"","hearts":3,"icon_image":{"28x28":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/pHK5rq41QhSpqplSh05a/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=28&h=28","48x48":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/pHK5rq41QhSpqplSh05a/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=48&h=48"},"id":"572b112b4fe7842400000015","latest_release":{"id":"580b1be453c08f01570000a9","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/iX0Yn5ajSCK3ZjpraJzL","published_date":"2016-10-22T08:04:54.678Z","release_notes":"Bug fixes.\r\nFirst release for Pebble Time 2.
