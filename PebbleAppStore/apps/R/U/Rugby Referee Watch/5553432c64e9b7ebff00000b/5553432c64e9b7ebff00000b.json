(*) Sections of code courtesy of Simon Taylor, Ambient Power Main Window (cycle through items with select button): - Period timer showing time elapsed and left. - Cards/Injuries timer (configurable duration): can store up to 10 cards/injuries and shows the next expiring ones. Injury timers run with real time, i.e. even when the match clock is paused. - Scores: you can scroll between the different score types (try/conv/pen/drop) to add a score and besides the total score the amounts of the single score types are shown as well (i.e. how many tries/convs/pens/drops). Undo last entry of a team with long press. - Information: shows information and instructions for a given mode. Settings screen (cycle through items with select button): - Can be accessed with select long-press and exited with back button. - Match period duration: you can increase/decrease by one minute. The value is persistently stored. - Card duration: same as above. - Injury duration: same as above. - History: here you can see a time-log of all events registered during the match (scores/cards/injuries/end-of-period). Only four are shown but you can scroll among them with the buttons. Clock still runs even upon exiting the app and automatically warns whenever a timer expires.","developer_id":"55115dc9daf20557a90000a9","header_images":[{"orig":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/Ojm5N7SxQD2BZOS9zhOg/convert?cache=true&fit=crop","720x320":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/Ojm5N7SxQD2BZOS9zhOg/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=720&h=320"}],"hearts":10,"icon_image":{"28x28":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/JUVytvOQQRHMeJ3d5ZDA/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=28&h=28","48x48":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/JUVytvOQQRHMeJ3d5ZDA/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=48&h=48"},"id":"5553432c64e9b7ebff00000b","latest_release":{"id":"56a207964ad4bbc7a3000031","js_md5":"8c43ce84c60c29ba81490f8f5e7d7094","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/TQxNapaSxWinHurHKXug","published_date":"2016-01-22T11:01:43.228Z","release_notes":"- Support aplite (Pebble Classic & Classic Steel) as well as basalt (Pebble Time & Time Steel).\r\n- Fullscreen.","version":"1.2"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5553432c64e9b7ebff00000b/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5553432c64e9b7ebff00000b/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5553432c64e9b7ebff00000b/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5553432c64e9b7ebff00000b/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5553432c64e9b7ebff00000b/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5553432c64e9b7ebff00000b/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/5553432c64e9b7ebff00000b"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/EQHBYPG5SgqrjZ2US1We/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/EQHBYPG5SgqrjZ2US1We/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-05-13T12:53:48.503Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/8BCZPR7TIiF1HZsc0VsL/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/6zWGWeSQRtyeTdY0NEW5/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/P9eY2lRFQGGOcI4h0l9f/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/XbN6iAWUTmTqKdlOCOYE/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/Mej3UyZWRAu7lAMeKMOt/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"Rugby Referee Watch","type":"watchapp","uuid":"333c6293-0fd9-4afb-9e72-3eb0e74d3e6d","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
