It shows hour, minute, second (if you like), date and a multi functional extra dial. The extra dial can be configured to - disappear from the watchface - work as a 24-hour dial which turns once a day, noon is at at position 6. Perfect for cave explorers. - track your activity either steps or time, your daily goal can be configured as well (this for sure needs a supporting Pebble watch and access to Pebble Health). You will start at noon (0%) and will hopefully end at noon (100%). - show a second time zone, just configure the desired difference in minutes. With this feature you can take a journey to even the craziest time zones on our planet. Seconds dial and date display can also be switched on or off, whatever fits your mood. If the Bluetooth connection breaks, the crown changes its color (2nd image). Battery status is realized with the seconds hand (if switched on). Below 40% remaining battery it starts to move every two seconds. Below 30% it moves every 3 seconds and below 20% the dial only moves every 5 seconds.
