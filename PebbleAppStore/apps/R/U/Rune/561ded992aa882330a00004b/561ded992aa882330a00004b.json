The hours are read across while the minutes are read downwards.  In \"Physical\" display mode, Rune's numbers are easily recognizable.  Rune also features a \"Mystical\" time telling mode which resembles the ancient rune symbols even more and easily perceptible with a little practice.\r\n\r\nTimes display on the screenshots:\r\n\r\n20:28\r\n08:13\r\n10:49\r\n(Rune symbols)\r\n\r\nIn addition to telling the time, Rune has features for showing the date, battery status and current weather conditions.  It also has three operating modes, including one which allows constant display of actual ancient runes (with the time available on \"tap\") and another \"Oracle\" mode to help answer those tough \"Yes, No, Maybe\" questions.\r\n\r\nThe Rune watch face for Pebble is modeled after the Rune Watch designed by Justin Schofield of the UK and published with his permission.  In fact, some of the text in this description is also Justin's work.\r\n\r\nMarketing Banner credits to Justin Schofield (with edits and screenshot updates by Ken Pettit).\r\n","developer_id":"56076e23ecf599f38a00002f","header_images":"","hearts":20,"id":"561ded992aa882330a00004b","latest_release":{"id":"561dedd5f7d9550ed8000031","js_md5":"fb280ccbf9bcc69b0e7e02853b401bba","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/UpQ0MGcNQtC23r1Bsihv","published_date":"2015-10-14T10:57:00.886Z","release_notes":"Initial release of RUNE.\r\n\r\nIncludes multiple operating modes and a tutorial that can be launched from the configuration page.","version":"1.0"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/561ded992aa882330a00004b/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/561ded992aa882330a00004b/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/561ded992aa882330a00004b/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/561ded992aa882330a00004b/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/561ded992aa882330a00004b/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/561ded992aa882330a00004b/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/561ded992aa882330a00004b"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/ChMEeUe4QFSp1hAVvmlD/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/ChMEeUe4QFSp1hAVvmlD/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-10-14T10:57:08.916Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/ChMEeUe4QFSp1hAVvmlD/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/KU3pgQWMSOqlCpwzNlQn/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/zlt71MysR2wBzikHob1t/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/OzlNUeveTbGkQDD8SfrF/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/Vfw4DYgRRrSBo0PsDVqe/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"Rune","type":"watchface","uuid":"24837e2f-51e0-462e-8a30-960521b3feb5","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
