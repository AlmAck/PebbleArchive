Just try it, I'm sure you'll appreciate it. \r\n\r\nThis is a non official and non profit project by Design Container developer Tommy Vitikka. I found the need for an easy, on the go solution for checking which Ruter-stop was closest and finding when the next transportation would arrive. Using the Ruter API, this was quite a joy to accomplish. \r\n\r\nGive it a like if you find it useful! \r\n\r\nSuccessfully tested on Pebble Steel and Pebble Time. \r\nNorwegian and English language settings available.","developer_id":"52fdcb804d6f7f1b7300013a","header_images":[{"orig":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/p5PaANaQ6560W7HlqiCQ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop","720x320":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/p5PaANaQ6560W7HlqiCQ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=720&h=320"}],"hearts":34,"icon_image":{"28x28":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/TqamObnhTVq2A1Izblwp/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=28&h=28","48x48":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/TqamObnhTVq2A1Izblwp/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=48&h=48"},"id":"5550f54e1113bcd347000052","latest_release":{"id":"566b440644cb3cce3100006a","js_md5":"9d58fd70903b5b6cdc80741ba94fe66a","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/3xIojZIcTqyEWc8Sdcla","published_date":"2015-12-11T21:47:46.811Z","release_notes":"A few performance optimizations for even happier travelling.
