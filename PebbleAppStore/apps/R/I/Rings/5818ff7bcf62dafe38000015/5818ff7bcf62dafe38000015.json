At 100%, the ring is complete. As battery level decreases, the arc reduces in length.\r\n\r\nThe innermost, blue ring, represents the bluetooth connection. When the connection is lost, a vibrate alert will also happen.","developer_id":"56d75054d75f26632d000037","header_images":"","hearts":6,"id":"5818ff7bcf62dafe38000015","latest_release":{"id":"582da88536ac5a06300003e5","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/P9mdft0gQziWvPmyPcao","published_date":"2016-11-17T12:54:53.079Z","release_notes":"Fixed issue where numbers less than 10 were not prefixed with a 0, causing an unacceptable time display!","version":"1.4"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5818ff7bcf62dafe38000015/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5818ff7bcf62dafe38000015/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5818ff7bcf62dafe38000015/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5818ff7bcf62dafe38000015/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5818ff7bcf62dafe38000015/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5818ff7bcf62dafe38000015/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/5818ff7bcf62dafe38000015"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/gpJGSiETQ6q24j4YYsSn/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/gpJGSiETQ6q24j4YYsSn/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2016-11-01T21:15:00.259Z","screenshot_hardware":"chalk","screenshot_images":[{"180x180":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/gpJGSiETQ6q24j4YYsSn/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=180&h=180"}],"source":"","title":"Rings","type":"watchface","uuid":"2a94ef9e-ff55-4b43-8448-9e2690979a61","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
