Whenever a motion or a noise is detected by the phone, a screenshot is sent to the Pebble watch, with an optional vibe.\r\n\r\nThe night mode produces images clear enough to make you see what happens even in very low light conditions, ideal to check that your baby is sleeping peacefully.\r\n\r\nYou can request, from the watch, to get a preview by just pressing a button. You can also trigger the phone to take a full res photo.\r\n \r\nThe iOS companion application comes with additional features :\r\n- live B&W preview of what *exactly* will be sent to the watch\r\n- enable/disable night mode\r\n- enable/disable buzz mode\r\n- choose front or back camera\r\n- select the noise threshold detection\r\n","developer_id":"52f053461ac7949119001436","header_images":[{"orig":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/n7lyV6zvSPysGEhuZFvY/convert?cache=true&fit=crop","720x320":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/n7lyV6zvSPysGEhuZFvY/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=720&h=320"}],"hearts":41,"icon_image":{"28x28":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/mLltE0flSg6seOl7I7NE/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=28&h=28","48x48":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/mLltE0flSg6seOl7I7NE/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=48&h=48"},"id":"54fcb3bfea06cc785c00007c","latest_release":{"id":"54ff730fae7d9e3aad00006f","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/bWo4zfmKTDyIvzBW3mYx","published_date":"2015-03-10T22:42:11.034Z","release_notes":"First release of Pebble app. Automatically launched when iPhone app is started.
