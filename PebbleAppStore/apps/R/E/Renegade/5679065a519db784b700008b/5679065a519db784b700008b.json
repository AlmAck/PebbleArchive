A group of humans travel back through time, taking refuge in different historical periods unable to return to their present time. This group is known as the RENEGADES. Their mission: to provide information to prevent the enslavement of the human race in the future.\r\n\r\nRENEGADE watchface is a tribute to these defenders of freedom.\"\r\n\r\n12 tall blocks are the hours,  5 medium height blocks are each 10 minutes and 9 small blocks are single minutes.\r\nThe blocks \"light up\" for each (blue for hours, yellow for 10 minutes and white for single minutes).   Just count the blocks for the time.\r\n\r\nAM/PM are represented by the lit circle top right.  Month, day of week and day of month also shown.\r\n\r\nNote: requires Pebble firmware 3.8 or above to run.\r\n\r\nScreenshots:\r\n(1)   3:25PM (Sunday, December 20)\r\n(2) 12:59PM (Wednesday, December 30)\r\n(3)   1:11AM (Monday, January 11)\r\n\r\nThis watchface design was created by Jos√© Manuel Otero, from Spain, and is published with his permission.
