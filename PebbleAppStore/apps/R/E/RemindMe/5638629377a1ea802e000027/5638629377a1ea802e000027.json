When those ideas come up, my usual way to treat them is to postpone them to after the task at hands, as I'm probably not in a position to take notes (hands are wet, or on the wheel, etc.).\r\nUnfortunately, most of the times I fail to remember the idea when I get in better disposition to write it down, or to process it.\r\n\r\n**RemindMe** is my solution to this problem. My own digital way, always on my wrist, to tie a knot to my handkerchief, to tie a string around my index finger, or to throw a slipper, a book, or any other unusual item in the middle of the room's floor.\r\n\r\n## How it works\r\n\r\nAt the moment **RemindMe**'s main screen is a list of all your notes, which you can enter to display in full or delete, and a way to add dictated notes. I suggest you link a Quick Launch button to **RemindMe**, so that you can open the \"new note\" dictation screen in only one long click from your watchface.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\nVersion 1.0 only includes a quick note system that allows you to create time-stamped text notes.","developer_id":"535657c3c822ffc62800014f","header_images":"","hearts":55,"icon_image":{"28x28":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/5wrsGGHWTEf9MAkEzXXB/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=28&h=28","48x48":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/5wrsGGHWTEf9MAkEzXXB/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=48&h=48"},"id":"5638629377a1ea802e000027","latest_release":{"id":"563ff137500343f1fa000006","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/D5VRh1LSO4WEqOmrfPuA","published_date":"2015-11-09T01:05:07.603Z","release_notes":"Fix a bug that prevented dictation session to work multiple times.","version":"1.2"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5638629377a1ea802e000027/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5638629377a1ea802e000027/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5638629377a1ea802e000027/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5638629377a1ea802e000027/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5638629377a1ea802e000027/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5638629377a1ea802e000027/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/5638629377a1ea802e000027"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/4aBcNt8EQIu0fhwIWpMn/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/4aBcNt8EQIu0fhwIWpMn/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-11-03T09:43:01.395Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/MWQhc8FRbWRXwzOEsT3Q/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/viNqC6JrS66uOOZQYWGl/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/fmH2tx6DQWW53HOlRp46/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/0Tt8pN5QAaXEz3UaDXoL/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"https://github.com/davidstosik/pebble-remind-me","title":"RemindMe","type":"watchapp","uuid":"bfac59e3-70e4-4400-9d57-17290531ff99","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
