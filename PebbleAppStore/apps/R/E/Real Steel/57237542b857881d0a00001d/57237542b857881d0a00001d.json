Minor UI changes make it work for Time series too.\r\n\r\nFunctions:\r\n•\tBluetooth disconnect vibration (Four long pulses, oh yeah)\r\n•\tCustomizable text (Name your watch ^_^ Once you name it, you start getting attached to it. –Mike Wazowski, Monsters, Inc.)\r\n•\tBattery information and charging animation (Easier to read than percentage and icon)\r\n•\tHourly weather information (Update every half hour and each load)\r\n•\tTemperature unit selection\r\n•\tSunrise, sunset and weather location information\r\n•\tFull name of month and day, week number, day of year and time zone name.\r\n•\tEach of above information can be turn on/off individually\r\n\r\nPlease give a heart if you like it, so more chances other people can find it. Thanks.\r\n\r\nAlso thanks to these two open-source watchfaces: “Timly” and “Weather My Way”\r\nCompiled with cloudpebble.net\r\n\r\nNotes about weather provider:\r\nOpenWeatherMap only has the current weather info, see the screenshot #4. A free API key is hard coded and shared for all users. Based on its spec, the limitation is max 60 calls per minute and Weather data update frequency is within 2 hours. \r\nHighly recommend the WUnderground hourly service. It is more accurate and stable, but you need to apply your own free develop API key. Limitation is max 10 calls per minute, 500 per day, but it is good enough for yourself without sharing with other users.\r\nhttps://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/\r\n","developer_id":"565ac0a5cb722e15fc000058","header_images":"","hearts":109,"id":"57237542b857881d0a00001d","latest_release":{"id":"5761619d1fc00cc6c0000067","js_md5":"8b5a6c23ece00d984a874cc3b711d1c8","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/DhdxluFcQkiK6xpdweis","published_date":"2016-06-15T14:10:28.393Z","release_notes":"Add back hour leading zeros to make UI more clean and consistent","version":"1.3"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57237542b857881d0a00001d/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57237542b857881d0a00001d/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57237542b857881d0a00001d/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57237542b857881d0a00001d/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57237542b857881d0a00001d/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57237542b857881d0a00001d/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/57237542b857881d0a00001d"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/8yZrjDQtS22sCKl5DzAF/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/8yZrjDQtS22sCKl5DzAF/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2016-05-11T05:47:53.865Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/8yZrjDQtS22sCKl5DzAF/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/1H0gBPS8OKVnnj8RNbgf/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/KtA05N7ARnyftR02phRj/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/TPfRRKcsTSexHFXpBLNQ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/KbhkDmt7Tl2VDCNoWq7W/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"Real Steel","type":"watchface","uuid":"da281e6a-9922-4c69-9080-1d9e9ee54085","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
