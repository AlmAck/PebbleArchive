We hope to make staying hydrated as effortless and entertaining as possible: say bye-bye to realizing after a workout or class period that you are parched!\r\n\r\nOur team hoped to tackle the growing trend of mild dehydration among Americans, by encouraging consistent water intake to reach the daily recommendation of 8 servings. Studies and our personal experience has shown huge impacts of dehydration vs staying hydrated including energy levels, muscle recovery, and brain functions. We hope to extend the benefits of increased water intake to you!\r\n\r\nKey features:\r\n\r\nAutomatic reminder system: pings your watch if you have not drank water in a while!\r\n\r\nStreak counter: rewards you for consistently reaching the recommended daily serving!\r\n\r\nEase-of-use: don't worry about a companion app, or bluetooth, or internet connection!\r\n\r\nFun icons and images: just because!\r\n\r\nPerfect For Anyone! We encourage everybody to be more aware of their hydration habits. While certain groups like athletes, students, elderly, or those with an illness need to be very conscious of their water intake, everybody can use a hand (or a watch :) ) in being aware of how much they should be drinking.\r\n\r\nFor those who are interested, you can read about the biology of our thirst drive and its faults here: http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature14108.html","developer_id":"54b92e29ffc3fdb279000053","header_images":[{"orig":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/qev5GOyhT2o1C0eLa5l0/convert?cache=true&fit=crop","720x320":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/qev5GOyhT2o1C0eLa5l0/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=720&h=320"}],"hearts":40,"icon_image":{"28x28":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/ubIhKy1ZQmaBAjMg9nCv/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=28&h=28","48x48":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/ubIhKy1ZQmaBAjMg9nCv/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=48&h=48"},"id":"54c025140badda221300007f","latest_release":{"id":"54c02602df63ce9c7200006f","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/P1MkwRYfSYKyppzwz3cx","published_date":"2015-01-21T22:23:50.965Z","release_notes":"","version":"1.0"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54c025140badda221300007f/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54c025140badda221300007f/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54c025140badda221300007f/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54c025140badda221300007f/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54c025140badda221300007f/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54c025140badda221300007f/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/54c025140badda221300007f"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/8xBdxOG4Seuqo2ysB7Cf/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/8xBdxOG4Seuqo2ysB7Cf/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-01-21T23:12:26.318Z","screenshot_hardware":"aplite","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/2cipgtyRj28jrWOQu6ew/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/Fxh99cTxRGKO8DXTvLRk/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/7IziXXARuOQ2falCO4Zl/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/aZNCDEDZR9y0xu6WiWHj/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/YC1hA1SSxurwUsOJa2Gg/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"https://github.com/a--hoang/pebble-reservoir","title":"Reservoir","type":"watchapp","uuid":"7addd9bc-aeb2-4a0e-836f-11c69bf00501","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
