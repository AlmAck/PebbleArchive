These shapes are \"rock\" (a simple fist), \"paper\" (a flat hand), and \"scissors\" (a fist with the index and middle fingers together forming a V). \r\n\r\nThe game has only three possible outcomes other than a tie: a player who decides to play rock will beat another player who has chosen scissors (\"rock crushes scissors\") but will lose to one who has played paper (\"paper covers rock\"); a play of paper will lose to a play of scissors (\"scissors cut paper\"). If both players throw the same shape, the game is tied.","developer_id":"547b78a720bfe2a30400006d","header_images":[{"orig":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/g5SPx3nTJyOgK5SfdLTQ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop","720x320":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/g5SPx3nTJyOgK5SfdLTQ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=720&h=320"}],"hearts":16,"icon_image":{"28x28":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/wQffxp0TMCQNjSp7AevQ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=28&h=28","48x48":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/wQffxp0TMCQNjSp7AevQ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=48&h=48"},"id":"55ce2434b7ea50a4d300003d","latest_release":{"id":"55e7af29acd5e9201200008c","js_md5":"182aacba19f68a94da75a151e61a76a7","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/v2QXSAkSNCjd0FUZtkW4","published_date":"2015-09-03T02:23:45.545Z","release_notes":"","version":"1.5"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55ce2434b7ea50a4d300003d/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55ce2434b7ea50a4d300003d/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55ce2434b7ea50a4d300003d/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55ce2434b7ea50a4d300003d/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55ce2434b7ea50a4d300003d/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55ce2434b7ea50a4d300003d/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/55ce2434b7ea50a4d300003d"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/Q1bh4CnHSGW0KfXT6bGU/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/Q1bh4CnHSGW0KfXT6bGU/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-09-04T00:57:29.731Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/44AKKNhRLSYHfqvOUO9U/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/BmrsVsdITu0PospOtFht/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"Rock Paper Scissors","type":"watchapp","uuid":"69506321-bae6-4a75-931e-d91ea8629390","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
