On a regular clock face, the hands would always form a right triangle at 3:00, but on the RandAlog Face, there's no telling what angle will form because the 3 and the 12 will be randomly positioned.\r\n\r\nThe odds of this face ever appearing like a regular clock face is 1 in 47,9001,600; or about once every 911 years.
