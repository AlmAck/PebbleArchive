At 3:00, the hour hand will point to the 3 (wherever on the clock face that may be) and the minute hand will point to the 12 (wherever that may be). On a regular clock face, the hands would always form a right triangle at 3:00, but on the RandAlog Face, there's no telling what angle will form because the 3 and the 12 will be randomly positioned. The odds of this face ever appearing like a regular clock face is 1 in 47,9001,600; or about once every 911 years.","developer_id":"557b6864bae8178be100008d","header_images":"","hearts":8,"id":"55e09d626cdee46e0d000043","latest_release":{"id":"55e0aa62d4f6d0a102000042","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/rlyj3cEwQR2Zhzu52rsv","published_date":"2015-08-28T18:37:39.526Z","release_notes":"Version 1, 8/28/2015, RandALog with roman numerals","version":"1.0"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55e09d626cdee46e0d000043/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55e09d626cdee46e0d000043/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55e09d626cdee46e0d000043/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55e09d626cdee46e0d000043/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55e09d626cdee46e0d000043/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55e09d626cdee46e0d000043/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/55e09d626cdee46e0d000043"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/BzT7roeOSVevTscW0Njd/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/BzT7roeOSVevTscW0Njd/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-08-28T18:37:43.222Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/BzT7roeOSVevTscW0Njd/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"RandALog Roman","type":"watchface","uuid":"628828d3-ade8-4327-968d-6432dcc8f284","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
