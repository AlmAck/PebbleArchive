The blocks inside the diagonal slots turn off incrementally to display the current time.\r\n\r\nThe hours are on the inner ring of slots (red) and the 5-minutes on the outer ring (cyan).  The inner slots that display the hours are in the traditional analogue position.  Following the line of the slots outward gives the 5-minute for that position.  A little bit tricky, but you soon get used to it.\r\n\r\nThe additional 4 single minutes are in the screw-like holes top, bottom, left and right, starting at the top.  \r\n\r\n2 final points to note: \r\n- At midday (12:00) all blocks are on\r\n- At midnight (00:00) all 5-minute blocks on, all hour blocks off\r\n\r\nScreenshots:\r\n (1)   6:13 \r\n (2)   8:44\r\n (3) 12:00\r\n (4) 00:00\r\n (5)   3:34 (with Quick View)\r\n\r\nDesign from Peter Fletcher, from the UK.
