How about reading the latest news from around the world, on your watch! You can simply scroll through a list of the latest news from various sources.\r\n\r\nWant to read the full article? We understand that the watch isn't the perfect place for that, but we have a solution -- simply select the headline and the app will store it to your personal online reading list*.\r\n\r\nThe new category menu will automatically organise the categories you view most to the top of the list.\r\n\r\nNOTE: This is a beta release. Any feedback (negative and positive) are welcome. Over the coming weeks, both the Pebble watch app and the companion website (which is where you will find the reading list) will go through some iterations.\r\n\r\n*The personal reading list can be found online. Once a headline is selected an alert will pop up with the exact url, which will look something like https://rss-news.appspot.com/pebble/9.","developer_id":"5560fb29a61f1614dd000109","header_images":[{"orig":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/iWsivwuYQdOPBeA2sMhS/convert?cache=true&fit=crop","720x320":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/iWsivwuYQdOPBeA2sMhS/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=720&h=320"}],"hearts":16,"icon_image":{"28x28":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/mb9dZPaS3ezwybRniiBj/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=28&h=28","48x48":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/mb9dZPaS3ezwybRniiBj/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=48&h=48"},"id":"559af63e5f43b79869000079","latest_release":{"id":"56bf42e62b777d1e42000009","js_md5":"10448a60708669a2c64b843e5ebaffdd","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/y8qn2rCNQ7WU6ekgZZ13","published_date":"2016-02-13T15:00:55.491Z","release_notes":" - Added category menu to the watch so that it's easier to navigate to other categorised news without using the config page on the phone (currently only supported in Pebble Time and Pebble Round).","version":"1.28"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/559af63e5f43b79869000079/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/559af63e5f43b79869000079/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/559af63e5f43b79869000079/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/559af63e5f43b79869000079/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/559af63e5f43b79869000079/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/559af63e5f43b79869000079/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/559af63e5f43b79869000079"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/GdCpcZnjRNWOsMqJqKfR/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/GdCpcZnjRNWOsMqJqKfR/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-07-07T00:09:51.613Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/WiSr815NTu6aNDs4eBST/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/r0SKyNLvTeedwOqhv6vu/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/AoScMi3SQZyQQl6Meir3/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/AcI5yItgTVi4JR08agqJ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"rss-news","type":"watchapp","uuid":"3a9f4e3d-3f01-446d-b8bf-b1d4da839d1f","website":"https://rss-news.appspot.com"}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
