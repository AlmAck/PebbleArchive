The amount of details is limited due to resolution restrictions. \r\n\r\n- You can configure how often the gears rotate*.\r\n- Hours and minutes are shown on the left and right gears respectively.\r\n- Rupee counter indicates seconds or day of year*.\r\n- Hearts indicate the amount of battery left.\r\n- Navi is there to keep you company. She gets replaced by a small bolt while charging.\r\n- Bluetooth status is indicated with the hookshot (since it hooks to your phone). It gets crossed when no BT connection is present.\r\n- Temperature is shown on the lower right and updated when you open the watchface** as well as approximately every hour. You can toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit within the Pebble app*.\r\n- Weekday and Monthday are shown on top by default, you can shake your wrist to briefly look at Month and Year, although if you shake* too hard the gears might have to readjust themselves ;-)\r\n\r\nIf you set the gears' rotation to off or 1/minute AND the rupee counter to day of year, the screen will only be updated once every minute.\r\n\r\n*Note that due to the way Pebble configuration works, you will need to have an internet connection active on your phone in order to access the watchface options.\r\n\r\n** Weather updates are done on the minute mark, it may take a couple of minutes to load.","developer_id":"54f473e5975f691677000041","header_images":"","hearts":163,"id":"55038e971d839c3065000009","latest_release":{"id":"5735c06e9ec4c14dc0000009","js_md5":"f9444986e397784527c4795ac09006c5","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/0RGJaw1pTLq60ZPzovEg","published_date":"2016-05-13T11:54:45.993Z","release_notes":"- Added chalk support\r\n- Added Navi\r\n- Artwork refinements","version":"4.0"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55038e971d839c3065000009/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55038e971d839c3065000009/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55038e971d839c3065000009/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55038e971d839c3065000009/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55038e971d839c3065000009/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55038e971d839c3065000009/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/55038e971d839c3065000009"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/ApyTxzRt8E0nax6IwS3R/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/ApyTxzRt8E0nax6IwS3R/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-03-14T01:31:02.873Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/ApyTxzRt8E0nax6IwS3R/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/oVW2GgLNTIeNfFJR3oqN/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"https://github.com/asardaes/pebble-zgot","title":"Legend of Zelda: Gate of Time","type":"watchface","uuid":"09d365d4-c918-43fd-9813-23fbd95b71ef","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
