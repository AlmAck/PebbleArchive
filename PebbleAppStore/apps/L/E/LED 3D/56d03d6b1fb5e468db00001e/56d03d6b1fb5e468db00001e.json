This demo includes solid, dithered and wireframe rending. Additionally the time digits and battery indicator perform an animation on every minute change.\r\n\r\nThe time is displayed in 12 hour or 24 hour format depending on your watch settings, and the digits are rendered with rainbow colors based on the time of day.\r\n\r\nThe battery indicator is usually green, but transitions to red at 20%.\r\n\r\nMy next project using the 3D engine is another watch face based on Star Wars, then I will write a 3D game for the Pebble. Look out for these in the near future, or email me with suggestions or to be notified of the next watch face or game.","developer_id":"561ad8fb43290f45e300001c","header_images":"","hearts":43,"id":"56d03d6b1fb5e468db00001e","latest_release":{"id":"56d1829d08b843cf19000010","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/lWqZBgOzQFqZveVU1kk7","published_date":"2016-02-27T11:04:12.834Z","release_notes":"Bug fix for 12 hour clock display. 00:xx is now shown correctly as 12:xx\r\nThanks Kevin","version":"1.2"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56d03d6b1fb5e468db00001e/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56d03d6b1fb5e468db00001e/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56d03d6b1fb5e468db00001e/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56d03d6b1fb5e468db00001e/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56d03d6b1fb5e468db00001e/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56d03d6b1fb5e468db00001e/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/56d03d6b1fb5e468db00001e"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/rOHIMS6SbGm0CLixj0Q0/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/rOHIMS6SbGm0CLixj0Q0/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2016-02-26T13:42:32.813Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/rOHIMS6SbGm0CLixj0Q0/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/glsMrbgcQQONuTYa7grP/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"LED 3D","type":"watchface","uuid":"076e807c-d4ad-4a09-8a11-45b212e5b8d7","website":"http://gektron.com"}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
