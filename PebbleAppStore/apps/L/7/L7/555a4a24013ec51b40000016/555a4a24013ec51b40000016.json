Reading the time is easy: the thin (red) line connects the hour digits, and the thicker (blue) connects the minute digits. Time is consequently read clockwise around the face, starting at the top. \r\n\r\nThe name? L7 as in ‘square’.\r\n\r\nThis will appeal to those who appreciate a geometric display that is somewhat cryptic, yet actually very easy to read. \r\n\r\nTime will display in 12-hour or 24-hour mode, depending on the watch setting.\r\n\r\nVersion 2 adds the configuration option to fill the areas rather than just have lines (user request) - see screenshot 5.\r\n\r\nThe screenshot examples show:  \r\n (1)   6:25 \r\n (2) 12:36\r\n (3)   4:35\r\n (4) 17:17 (in 24-hour mode) \r\n (5)   8:17 (filled)\r\n\r\nDesign from the Tokyoflash Design Studio, created by Anders Svedell.
