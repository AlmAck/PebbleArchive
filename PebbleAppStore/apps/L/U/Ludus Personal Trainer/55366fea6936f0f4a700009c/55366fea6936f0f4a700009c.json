Improve your accuracy by connecting your Pebble Watch to the app. It’ll tell you when you hit the right posture, showing your avatar following your moves live on your Apple TV screen.\r\n\r\nIn order to plan your next workout, Ludus will ask you to rate how you feel after each exercise. It’s designed to evolve with you and your goals!\r\nAfter each session, you’ll see a summary of how you did. You can comment and share your progress – along with any badges you've earned – with your friends.
