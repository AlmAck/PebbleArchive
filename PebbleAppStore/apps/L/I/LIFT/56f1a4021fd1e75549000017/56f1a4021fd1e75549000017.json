You can choose between 12h and 24h clock in the pebble settings.\r\n\r\nWhile one hour pass, the red panel which shows the time, slides from the top (when the hour began) to the bottom (when the our is nearly over).\r\n\r\nQuickView is supported and Vibrate-on-disconnect added :)\r\n\r\nATTENTION: It's not pink like in the screenshots, it's red!\r\n\r\n\r\nImagine you hava a deadline until 4pm, so you are in hurry because you have not much time left. The watch should now just quickly show the time left, but reading the time may distract you shortly. To prevent this and provide fast the time, you can see the panel (and its distance to the bottom) and guess roughly what time time it is. This is faster, and when when it reaches 4pm, the panel stays on the top af the screen.\r\n\r\nDo you like this? Give me a ♥\r\n\r\nThis watchface works on all pebble smartwatches.\r\nDo you want to customize it yourself? See my github.\r\n\r\n","developer_id":"56dab64f59ab332abd00000b","header_images":"","hearts":94,"id":"56f1a4021fd1e75549000017","latest_release":{"id":"58190527d8b7e7149a00000a","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/lAvKQOeQCeoGA3uHUXuw","published_date":"2016-11-01T21:17:27.863Z","release_notes":"Emery (Pebble Time 2) support","version":"1.4"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56f1a4021fd1e75549000017/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56f1a4021fd1e75549000017/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56f1a4021fd1e75549000017/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56f1a4021fd1e75549000017/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56f1a4021fd1e75549000017/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56f1a4021fd1e75549000017/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/56f1a4021fd1e75549000017"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/GFmln5L2SfWevYV5p9eX/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/GFmln5L2SfWevYV5p9eX/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2016-03-23T12:28:47.034Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/GFmln5L2SfWevYV5p9eX/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/2Jul2ycS1Sr1vJXehaJe/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/7qH4LKRDaDt1V4SkpmZw/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/Mvsl3kWgSrycFTN9fLRw/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/shcYdkoMSGQs5Zx6peJT/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"https://github.com/WuerfelDev/LIFT/","title":"LIFT","type":"watchface","uuid":"43009881-61fd-4afb-92d8-cd5e5fb62f2b","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
