Rocket Lovers! People who like it when things go boom in the right direction! Have you ever wanted to know when those pillars of ingenuity are destined to leave the bonds of earth's gravity in a blaze of glory? With Liftoff, now you can! \r\n\r\nLiftoff is a timeline-filler app that uses the free API available at launchlibrary.net to give users the ability to see at a glance when and where a rocket launches, and see the rocket's mission. Liftoff also provides handy reminders, at 15 minutes before and at the expected launch time, to let you know when a launch happens. \r\n\r\nLiftoff isn't isolated to the progression of the United States. It can see the liftoff times of any rocket, anywhere (that's publicly available, that is). And if you don't want to see rockets from a specific country? No worries! The configuration page provides you the ability to select from at least 16 different locations, of which you can subscribe and unsubscribe to with ease. \r\n\r\nAnd now with update 1.1.0, you can easily access more information or video streams via an on-watch QR code, directing you to those links when available.\r\n\r\nWhat are you waiting for, star-gazer? Get Liftoff installed now!","developer_id":"55e827430a081ae5f9000009","header_images":[{"orig":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/UGMK5QnQqyiJnQcS7c8w/convert?cache=true&fit=crop","720x320":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/UGMK5QnQqyiJnQcS7c8w/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=720&h=320"}],"hearts":65,"icon_image":{"28x28":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/MG9to5eJRb6tPJeBIY7T/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=28&h=28","48x48":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/MG9to5eJRb6tPJeBIY7T/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=48&h=48"},"id":"57c2fc8cf69d1d7a390002ea","latest_release":{"id":"583b0dcc00355abe660006b3","js_md5":"680a11186f7a1953d1ad71f63e4ddc9b","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/UMkYF0M8SFWtraG4q5KY","published_date":"2016-11-27T16:46:17.883Z","release_notes":"- Added donation link to config page","version":"1.3"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57c2fc8cf69d1d7a390002ea/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57c2fc8cf69d1d7a390002ea/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57c2fc8cf69d1d7a390002ea/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57c2fc8cf69d1d7a390002ea/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57c2fc8cf69d1d7a390002ea/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57c2fc8cf69d1d7a390002ea/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/57c2fc8cf69d1d7a390002ea"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/unZy8YqZQqeIqzK6zyV8/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/unZy8YqZQqeIqzK6zyV8/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2016-11-08T19:35:40.426Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/JYf4eGIaSBYOIFdSgDYj/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/M0snLIcaQ6CS5dMsSdmO/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/lFW2oIH4RQ9A8ov6mZCE/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/YSrDbQs6SZmKFtgSmauH/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"Liftoff","type":"watchapp","uuid":"3d192c56-8507-4c65-93f7-f18645282a1c","website":"http://thomas.stoeckert.us/getliftoff/"}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
