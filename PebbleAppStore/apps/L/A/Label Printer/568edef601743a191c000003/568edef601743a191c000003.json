Introducing AccuFuzzyTime - in 'Fuzzy Time' mode, the watch is still sort of fuzzy, but if we're just before a time (say 15:14) it'll report it as 'Almost quarter past 3', and just after the time (say 15:16) it says 'About quarter past 3'.  It's still reluctant to be pinned down to an actual time, but it's a bit more honest now."},{"version":"1.71","published_date":"2016-01-24T22:39:01.187Z","release_notes":"24/01/16 - Version 1.71:\r\n\r\nI messed up shake-for-date on monochrome Pebbles after that last update, but now it is fixed."},{"version":"1.7","published_date":"2016-01-24T19:03:25.373Z","release_notes":"24/01/16 - Version 1.7:\r\n\r\nFixed a problem with longer Italian numbers not fitting on the 4th line properly when using a round watch.  It's a niche case but it's fixed now so that should be good.\r\n\r\nFixed it so you can now choose different colours for the background, labels and text on colour Pebbles.  Hey!  It looks much better now!"},{"version":"1.6","published_date":"2016-01-22T10:58:10.081Z","release_notes":"22/01/16 - Version 1.6:\r\n\r\nImplemented 'shake-for-date' - give your wrist a jolt and you'll know the date!  Goes back to time display after 10 seconds.\r\n\r\nAdded an option for 'fuzzy time' - the watch will display the time to the nearest five minutes, but will adjust its language appropriately when it's not being 100% accurate."},{"version":"1.5","published_date":"2016-01-19T21:37:29.337Z","release_notes":"19/01/2016 - Version 1.5:\r\n\r\nAltered the Italian version so shorter words are displayed in the larger font.
