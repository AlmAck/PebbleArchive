A long hold of the middle button on the main screen while a timer is running will pause it and resume it. Selecting quicken will double the recharge rate and will be cleared once your energy pool is full or the timer canceled. You can set up accelerated recharge where the amount you increase by goes up every so many ticks.\r\n\r\nThis was designed for Dark Prospects but I tried to make it flexible enough to work in other games.","developer_id":"52b21441cd41836178000058","header_images":"","hearts":2,"icon_image":{"28x28":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/dC3V8B7R8e1Cl42ZXbyQ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=28&h=28","48x48":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/dC3V8B7R8e1Cl42ZXbyQ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=48&h=48"},"id":"57e622cf87d6bbe13f0002c5","latest_release":{"id":"57f9494256fda5ba37000061","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/yixxDUmSQEuzgItaChN9","published_date":"2016-10-08T19:31:59.225Z","release_notes":"Fixes for problems found on first use in a game.","version":"1.1"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57e622cf87d6bbe13f0002c5/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57e622cf87d6bbe13f0002c5/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57e622cf87d6bbe13f0002c5/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57e622cf87d6bbe13f0002c5/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57e622cf87d6bbe13f0002c5/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57e622cf87d6bbe13f0002c5/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/57e622cf87d6bbe13f0002c5"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/PnKcJdiXTU6bARbUxD4i/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/PnKcJdiXTU6bARbUxD4i/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2016-10-15T22:27:10.819Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/KU5PKIHHTQihaW828HWS/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/H5VY5BNcSpC5xgU5wZPx/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/MotBCWQRsuXElioaTG75/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"LARP Energy Timer","type":"watchapp","uuid":"7bd8157e-1026-4eaa-a55e-456c22231ddf","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
