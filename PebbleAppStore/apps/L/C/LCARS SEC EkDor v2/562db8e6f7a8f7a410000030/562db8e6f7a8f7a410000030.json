I tried to use the watch face generator using the beta fonts to add second and place them in the thick white bar, which sort of worked. But the custom fonts setting adds a zero before the hour which annoyed me a lot. And the classic settings don't allow me to turn off hour and minutes or split their positions. Oh well.","developer_id":"554bc06892dfd3378700009d","header_images":"","hearts":3,"id":"562db8e6f7a8f7a410000030","latest_release":{"id":"562db95d1eef0e6dac00003f","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/rllHKtPGSXi1SFchQsD3","published_date":"2015-10-26T05:26:08.586Z","release_notes":"Changed the font","version":"1.0"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/562db8e6f7a8f7a410000030/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/562db8e6f7a8f7a410000030/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/562db8e6f7a8f7a410000030/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/562db8e6f7a8f7a410000030/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/562db8e6f7a8f7a410000030/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/562db8e6f7a8f7a410000030/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/562db8e6f7a8f7a410000030"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/MX4W4V4aR5iWD84YJhqx/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/MX4W4V4aR5iWD84YJhqx/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-10-26T05:26:21.299Z","screenshot_hardware":"aplite","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/MX4W4V4aR5iWD84YJhqx/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"LCARS SEC EkDor v2","type":"watchface","uuid":"13371337-061b-4f92-a754-f5ddf4a69155","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
