Locomo will show you how much time you have left, if your train is on time and which platform you need to go to.\r\n\r\nIt uses geolocation to detect if you are going from home to work or the other way around.\r\nUse the up and down buttons to navigate to earlier or later trains (or refresh by going all the way up). The middle button will switch modes between going to work or returning home.\r\n\r\nOnly works in the UK (for now).","developer_id":"560fd7a8ba529bd5f4000094","header_images":[{"orig":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/ZLKVckD4RLiHbu2DgrmR/convert?cache=true&fit=crop","720x320":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/ZLKVckD4RLiHbu2DgrmR/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=720&h=320"},{"orig":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/mM6bgSRairbHKamillEA/convert?cache=true&fit=crop","720x320":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/mM6bgSRairbHKamillEA/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=720&h=320"},{"orig":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/A8vfQTRfCc2g3jqiMm3Q/convert?cache=true&fit=crop","720x320":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/A8vfQTRfCc2g3jqiMm3Q/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=720&h=320"}],"hearts":46,"icon_image":{"28x28":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/G4eweKwSRze9mZ1tZ4bD/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=28&h=28","48x48":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/G4eweKwSRze9mZ1tZ4bD/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=48&h=48"},"id":"5738e66eeae0b2ef05000024","latest_release":{"id":"57fe4cdb2cde65fedf00014c","js_md5":"19ba28cf4685749a3ab44dacba204c8a","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/tHJHXuLSRCIgH4U1ldt5","published_date":"2016-10-12T14:58:33.192Z","release_notes":"Updated with some Pebble 4.0 love.\r\n- Got some pretty menu icon now\r\n- Added support for Diorite (Pebble 2)\r\n- Added App Glance that shows platform even after closing the app\r\n- New lighter and better settings page\r\n- The usual improving code and fixing bugs","version":"2.1"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5738e66eeae0b2ef05000024/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5738e66eeae0b2ef05000024/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5738e66eeae0b2ef05000024/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5738e66eeae0b2ef05000024/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5738e66eeae0b2ef05000024/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5738e66eeae0b2ef05000024/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/5738e66eeae0b2ef05000024"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/7eI6kmpNQsK5yOoCbJed/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/7eI6kmpNQsK5yOoCbJed/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2016-05-18T22:19:40.780Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/0ZxKkdXGTdDhLnoe8rM8/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/lCszJq5zRlGW7stywuut/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/Y5oxU5tGRXyadj9qJeAN/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/h5OPFdlgTUuELMWLj3Kp/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"https://github.com/yoziru-desu/locomo-pebble","title":"Locomo","type":"watchapp","uuid":"1e425643-5965-4df3-9e0e-40482f9f5ae2","website":"http://paypal.me/yoziru"}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
