Whether you want to track smartstrap output (e.g. GPS or heart rate), built-in sensor data (compass, accelerometer), or your own custom-defined events and properties, Log allows you to collect the data that's important to you, and easily visualize the results.\r\n\r\n*** OPEN BETA ***\r\nThis version of Log features limited functionality.  We need your help validating the underlying technology - give it a download, press some buttons, look at the graphs (currently via config) and let us know what you think!  The current build allows you to manually track your charging habits - and at present all user data is aggregated.  If you like the idea, let us know, and we may invite you to test smartstrap, health, voice, and other custom functionality! :)\r\n\r\nThank you for your help, and feel free to get in touch with any questions, feedback, or suggestions! :)","developer_id":"52f1ada1f216769cb90007ca","header_images":"","hearts":13,"icon_image":{"28x28":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/LwRP2cbaRUSgT0kjboFA/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=28&h=28","48x48":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/LwRP2cbaRUSgT0kjboFA/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=48&h=48"},"id":"5766525e3feaee4aa3000192","latest_release":{"id":"578b1d9b1e00a6b3c70001ce","js_md5":"0466e0b9e0c68f652ee2ae3fa733934a","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/ewM5RO2JQnm6GH082oFN","published_date":"2016-07-17T05:55:00.882Z","release_notes":"Added status bar, compass and accelerometer measurement! :)","version":"0.4"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5766525e3feaee4aa3000192/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5766525e3feaee4aa3000192/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5766525e3feaee4aa3000192/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5766525e3feaee4aa3000192/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5766525e3feaee4aa3000192/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5766525e3feaee4aa3000192/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/5766525e3feaee4aa3000192"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/53f52Bc7QcSrS1kBfVr8/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/53f52Bc7QcSrS1kBfVr8/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2016-06-19T08:36:57.021Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/p6VfY5lRdmcIF2k3P0i6/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"Log - Data Collection and Visualization (BETA)","type":"watchapp","uuid":"b4b21f83-3213-4d3f-b2a4-2a54b36a4f38","website":"http://hot-dog.io"}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
