Please donate: http://bit.ly/2awtWST\r\n\r\nHow does it work?\r\nSimply leave the Pebble application running and when you are within 35 meters (or notification distance set in settings) of a Pokemon your Pebble will vibrate and display the nearby Pokemon information. If no Pokemon are within the notification distance a list of Pokemon nearby will be displayed.\r\n\r\nQ. Searching... is displayed with no nearby Pokemon?\r\nA. Servers could be overloaded, or you are in an area with no nearby Pokemon.\r\n\r\nQ. Do I need to run the Pokemon Go application on my phone at the same time?\r\nA. No, the Pebble application works independently of the Pokemon Go application on your phone.\r\n\r\n== TODO/IMPROVEMENTS ==\r\n1. Additional language programming for full multi language capability.\r\n\r\nNot affiliated with Niantic or Nintendo.
