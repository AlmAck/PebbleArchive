It wants to be both, but it can’t be 100% one or the other. It has a split personality, and jumps over massive hurdles to get by with its personality problem. It ends up being exactly half analog and digital – and needs major psychotherapy to rectify the tension created by its dual personality. \r\n\r\nFortunately for the user, telling the time is easy!\r\nThere is logic to how the hours and seconds (and optional date) get displayed, but it seems crazy!\r\n\r\nHours: Large Digits\r\nMinutes: Physical Hand\r\nSeconds: Small Digits or Partial Analog Hand\r\n\r\nConfiguration options:\r\n Date - no date (default), MM/DD or DD/MM.\r\n Seconds - show (default) or hide.\r\n  \r\nVersion 3 adds support for Pebble Time Round.\r\n    \r\nThe first two screenshots are animations (the first with date) showing:\r\n(1)   9:59:55 to 10:00:05\r\n(2) 10:40:25 to 10:40:35\r\nThe other screenshots show:  \r\n(3) 7:58:34    (4) 8:02:32    (5) 10:17:15\r\n\r\nDesign from the Tokyoflash Design Studio, created by Dietrich Faust.
