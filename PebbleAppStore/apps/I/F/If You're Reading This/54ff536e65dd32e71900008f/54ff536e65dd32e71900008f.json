Look at the album artwork!) . Compatible with all Pebble watches.\r\n\r\nThis watchface includes a feature that will cause the watch to vibrate and the color of the watchface to invert (black with white text vs white with black text) to alert you when your Pebble has disconnected from your phone. This way, you never loose your phone!\r\n\r\nAny comments, suggestions, or requests can be sent to me through the support link below. Don't forget to like!
