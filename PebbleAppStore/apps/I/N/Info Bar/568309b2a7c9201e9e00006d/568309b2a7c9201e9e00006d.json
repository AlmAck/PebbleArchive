A unified bar of important information spans across the middle of the watch. This is a useful design for looking at more than just the time without clutter getting in the way.\r\n \r\nShows:\r\n - Time\r\n - Seconds\r\n - Day of the week\r\n - Date\r\n - Battery percentage\r\n \r\n...all in an easy to read arrangement. Enjoy this and please leave a heart for a 16 year old amateur coder! Be sure to check out my new Android M watchface as well.\r\n \r\nSupports all watches! Only in English at this time.","developer_id":"567d73cfa2dee26dc00001a2","header_images":"","hearts":71,"id":"568309b2a7c9201e9e00006d","latest_release":{"id":"56948416bc80b905d1000022","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/bcTe3JJ7RWO2hLjnXAIh","published_date":"2016-01-12T04:48:25.114Z","release_notes":"- Added icon for onboard watchface picker","version":"1.3"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/568309b2a7c9201e9e00006d/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/568309b2a7c9201e9e00006d/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/568309b2a7c9201e9e00006d/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/568309b2a7c9201e9e00006d/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/568309b2a7c9201e9e00006d/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/568309b2a7c9201e9e00006d/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/568309b2a7c9201e9e00006d"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/CNRKxheHRna1yFXK6r7q/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/CNRKxheHRna1yFXK6r7q/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-12-29T22:44:14.120Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/CNRKxheHRna1yFXK6r7q/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/o4v243yrifqd88d/Info%20Bar%201.3%20source.zip?dl=0","title":"Info Bar","type":"watchface","uuid":"330a6d50-9107-4dd4-a1c0-a04e58c4690e","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
