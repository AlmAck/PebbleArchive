Switched to Indigo XML RESTful API which handles Unicode better for our international friends.\r\n\r\n2. Added an Item Filter configuration setting which will only return devices/actions that start with the filter value. It strips the filter from the item name. For example, if you have some devices to show on your Pebble, you could name them: PebbleRoom1, PebbleRoom2, and on your watch you will see: Room1 and Room2. This is in lieu of being able to specify a folder that contains the items of interest because that isn't yet supported by Indigo.\r\n\r\n3. Various bug fixes and better error handling."},{"version":"2.0","published_date":"2015-07-19T22:37:26.418Z","release_notes":"New in 2.0:\r\n- Fixed a bug where the port option would always reset to 8000\r\n- Added support for authenticated connections to Indigo Server\r\n- Added support for Prism Reflector"}],"companions":{"ios":null,"android":null},"compatibility":{"ios":{"supported":true,"min_js_version":-1},"android":{"supported":true},"aplite":{"supported":true,"firmware":{"major":2}},"basalt":{"supported":true,"firmware":{"major":3}},"chalk":{"supported":false,"firmware":{"major":3}},"diorite":{"supported":true,"firmware":{"major":3}},"emery":{"supported":true,"firmware":{"major":3}}},"created_at":"2015-04-30T00:28:39.616Z","description":"An updated version of Zach Benz's Indigo Remote app. A remote control for Perceptive Automation's excellent Indigo home automation server for Mac OS X.
