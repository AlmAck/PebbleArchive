Always available on their wrist can be the most simple and essential of information one might need when going Ingressing. Maybe you just want to show your faction's colours, and be proud of where you belong. Either way, IngressFace can let you do it.\r\n\r\nIf you have never heard of Ingress, you should really check it out. It's augmented-reality at its finest! Anyone can play!\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n- Current time\r\n- Current date\r\n- Next checkpoint (according to the user's timezone)\r\n- Displayed battery percentage\r\n- Colour/icon schemes according to your chosen faction\r\n- Choice between date formats and/or use of a seconds ticker\r\n- Choice between countdown or simple time display for next checkpoint\r\n\r\nCredit for the 3 icons loaded in the bottom right corner of the watchface goes to cr0ybot and their fantastic skills. Very high-quality and large versions of all sorts of Ingress logos can be found on their GitHub (https://github.com/cr0ybot/ingress-logos). The icons used in this watchface are modifications of cr0ybot's.","developer_id":"55d85c3b6f697eced30000b7","header_images":"","hearts":44,"id":"568a50ad142c4f161a000048","latest_release":{"id":"57db5eb02d0cc8dcb4000108","js_md5":"41ae898078e167f0453441348d0b8ba9","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/qGndzx4hT1WW2NI3hCnl","published_date":"2016-09-16T02:54:10.403Z","release_notes":"- Stability and optimisation improvements","version":"2.11"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/568a50ad142c4f161a000048/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/568a50ad142c4f161a000048/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/568a50ad142c4f161a000048/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/568a50ad142c4f161a000048/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/568a50ad142c4f161a000048/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/568a50ad142c4f161a000048/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/568a50ad142c4f161a000048"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/D3PNrwOQoWHFBHqwTmJw/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/D3PNrwOQoWHFBHqwTmJw/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2016-01-04T11:13:14.172Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/D3PNrwOQoWHFBHqwTmJw/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/6hqnSWgTlCb1molknGdg/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/P7okMLpKTfOnHM7Z9u3d/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/QNtf1IiQRqynP45zOilZ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/XC8Tu2mjQhyhIyFMMTdv/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"https://github.com/lenku/IngressFace","title":"IngressFace","type":"watchface","uuid":"75b13ada-5e68-4a51-acc6-0249c80e2fd2","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
