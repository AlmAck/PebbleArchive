You just need to note the differences between the 1 and the 7, and the rest should come naturally.\r\n \r\nDisplays in 12-hour or 24-hour format, depending on watch settings.\r\n \r\nScreenshots show:  \r\n (1) 10:24\r\n (2) 09:03 (inverted)\r\n (3) 20:39 (24-hour format)\r\n (4) 23:58 (24-hour format, inverted)\r\n \r\nDesigned by Heather Sable and originally appeared on the Tokyoflash Design Studio.
