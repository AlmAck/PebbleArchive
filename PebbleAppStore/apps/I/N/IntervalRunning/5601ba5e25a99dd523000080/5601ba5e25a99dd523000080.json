For example you could start with 5 seconds run then do 5 seconds walk, then you take 10 seconds to run and 10 seconds to walk. When you reach one minute counting turns back till 5 seconds. Those parameters could be configured with app settings to fit your needs.\r\nInterval training is a technique particularly employed by runners, but athletes in many disciplines use this type of training!\r\n","developer_id":"54b826472e38eb366300008f","header_images":[{"orig":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/NgetLwKERWvQYjkSlALP/convert?cache=true&fit=crop","720x320":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/NgetLwKERWvQYjkSlALP/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=720&h=320"}],"hearts":11,"icon_image":{"28x28":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/OjAfTusWSoCbMIxvvEfP/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=28&h=28","48x48":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/OjAfTusWSoCbMIxvvEfP/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=48&h=48"},"id":"5601ba5e25a99dd523000080","latest_release":{"id":"56b28ff4bbe2125a8800005d","js_md5":"d9220b81bf9b8ad739652ce3f0333fac","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/xZGbgeeQPaFKmTxhNmdQ","published_date":"2016-03-29T11:44:13.083Z","release_notes":"Distance measurement was added.","version":"1.3"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5601ba5e25a99dd523000080/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5601ba5e25a99dd523000080/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5601ba5e25a99dd523000080/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5601ba5e25a99dd523000080/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5601ba5e25a99dd523000080/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5601ba5e25a99dd523000080/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/5601ba5e25a99dd523000080"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/VAmTrSnaTPWuYHo8xAxr/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/VAmTrSnaTPWuYHo8xAxr/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2016-04-04T21:12:43.090Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/xjgJbA6gSxGcByjy2yHn/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/q0I9uIU4Tp6cLFbYItn9/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/VtEfNBZPQFXZW8PL4DQE/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"IntervalRunning","type":"watchapp","uuid":"45a4e336-2311-440a-bda1-855285b0cd20","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
