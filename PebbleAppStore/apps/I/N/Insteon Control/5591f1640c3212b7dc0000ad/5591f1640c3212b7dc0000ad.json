Only reason it's up is because the users who it *was* functioning for requested I leave it up.\r\nThis app uses Insteon's API, letting you control your home lights and scenes. I wanted to stop looking for my phone when I wanted to activate my \"Movies\" scene, or when I wanted to turn the house off as I went to bed, so I wrote this. \r\n\r\nDirections:\r\nStart by setting up the config inside the Pebble app on your phone.\r\nWhen selecting a device or scene, a short press turns it on, long press is off.\r\n\r\nNOTE:\r\nOne user has informed the the config option did not work for them. Please let me know by email or on IRC if you hit the same issue, and I'll be happy to help diagnose it. \r\n\r\nCompatibility:\r\nThis app is only compatible with the Hub 2 (2245-222) since Insteon's API doesn't work with the others.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI named my Insteon API key account \"TBD\" because I never planned on actually publishing an app.\r\nThe shown pictures are lame, because the app isn't very featured yet, and I currently don't have plans for it to become much more featured. \r\n\r\nKnown Bugs/Issues:\r\n- Does not show current status\r\n- 2-device wall outlets will only control the top outlet (This is a limitation of the API)\r\n- Nothing outside of lights/outlets works (no thermostat, remote sensors, etc. Known issue with the API)\r\n\r\nFeel free to contact me with comments/bugs/suggestions. I also idle in the #insteon and #pebble channels on Freenode as swiss.","developer_id":"5396b6edae4b4c2f8800000d","header_images":[{"orig":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/ZTzooQLcSrKdDmW63wA6/convert?cache=true&fit=crop","720x320":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/ZTzooQLcSrKdDmW63wA6/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=720&h=320"}],"hearts":21,"icon_image":{"28x28":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/lwyHu0aGSbGNYQ034GMa/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=28&h=28","48x48":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/lwyHu0aGSbGNYQ034GMa/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=48&h=48"},"id":"5591f1640c3212b7dc0000ad","latest_release":{"id":"5591fd87d0d3f3c6c10000af","js_md5":"4b206213e87e0b07e2275cd8785df696","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/QdSoe3UET62xIDH2tnSZ","published_date":"2015-06-30T02:23:26.319Z","release_notes":"Fixed small bug that required you to exit the app to refresh your settings.","version":"1.01"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5591f1640c3212b7dc0000ad/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5591f1640c3212b7dc0000ad/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5591f1640c3212b7dc0000ad/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5591f1640c3212b7dc0000ad/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5591f1640c3212b7dc0000ad/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5591f1640c3212b7dc0000ad/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/5591f1640c3212b7dc0000ad"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/oVqddScS9KcgiISbVk4w/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/oVqddScS9KcgiISbVk4w/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2016-04-14T00:57:13.461Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/AL1KTtn3Tlyn3HqSK4zL/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"https://github.com/SwissKid/pebble-insteon-control","title":"Insteon Control","type":"watchapp","uuid":"5a95601f-5355-4e77-ab35-0b338784a1df","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
