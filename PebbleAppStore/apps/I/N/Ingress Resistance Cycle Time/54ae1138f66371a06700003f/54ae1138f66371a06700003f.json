Hi, fellow pebble time users!\r\nPlease go into the watchface settings to turn on the timeline data I'm adding. It's best effort, including things like shard jump times, shard scoring, and measurement start/end for North American anomalies (sorry, going to focus on EU a bit later!)"},{"version":"2.1","published_date":"2015-05-16T08:54:54.691Z","release_notes":"Proper timezone support for Pebble Time. (Shhh!)"},{"version":"2.0","published_date":"2015-05-08T21:21:54.107Z","release_notes":"Color Support: Adjusted colors to ones that look awesome on the real thing."},{"version":"1.9","published_date":"2015-05-08T19:07:50.961Z","release_notes":"Fixed broken color icon in Enlightened App - Just a version bump for the Resistance one."},{"version":"1.8","published_date":"2015-05-07T16:53:05.616Z","release_notes":"App storage writes in the bluetooth comm module seem to affect stability. As a result, we check to see if the write needs to be made by checking the received offset versus the currently operating offset. This limits write activities and should avoid crashes."},{"version":"1.7","published_date":"2015-05-06T20:02:34.501Z","release_notes":"Added persistence for timezones so a dead phone doesn't mean you won't know what checkpoint is, provided you were in the right timezone when it died.\r\n\r\nAdded Pebble Color support (!)"},{"version":"1.6","published_date":"2015-04-13T17:15:29.308Z","release_notes":"* Removes vibrate on BT connected (meaning it doesn't vibrate when you start the watchface)\r\n* Decreases required GPS precision and fix time - it either gets a fix and a region, or it bails and at least gives you a time offset quickly\r\n* Decreases app logging, which ironically should fix the final crash bugs. *sigh*"},{"version":"1.5","published_date":"2015-04-06T23:53:26.185Z","release_notes":"Clean up the heap a little better. 3rd push today, this one's just for better practices. Contains the anti-crash and anti-bloodlust patches of the last two, but now uses less watch memory!"},{"version":"1.4","published_date":"2015-04-06T22:43:38.461Z","release_notes":"One more bug caused by a previous bug fix that caused the watch to enter a endless update loop under some circumstances where the phone was previously told \"no matter what, never send an update more than X minutes\" - The watch doesn't like being told no and asked repeatedly, once a second. It doesn't do that anymore, and the phone also always does what it is asked."},{"version":"1.3","published_date":"2015-04-06T15:41:25.182Z","release_notes":"Sated the watch's thirst for battery and the blood of innocents. 100% less crashes, same great functionality when it isn't busy crashing."},{"version":"1.2","published_date":"2015-01-31T04:07:19.164Z","release_notes":"Major changes include seconds display (only shows countdown in seconds within 5 minutes of checkpoint) date display, timezone fixes (sorry about that! I tested throughly this time, and support +0:30 offsets and other stuff now) and changes to battery indication. FUTURE RELEASE PLANS: AM/PM preferences, changeable/removable faction logo, and display of UTC time."},{"version":"1.0","published_date":"2015-01-08T05:13:29.701Z","release_notes":"Initial Release"}],"companions":{"ios":null,"android":null},"compatibility":{"ios":{"supported":true,"min_js_version":25},"android":{"supported":true},"aplite":{"supported":true,"firmware":{"major":2}},"basalt":{"supported":true,"firmware":{"major":3}},"chalk":{"supported":false,"firmware":{"major":3}},"diorite":{"supported":true,"firmware":{"major":3}},"emery":{"supported":true,"firmware":{"major":3}}},"created_at":"2015-01-08T05:10:16.155Z","description":" The watchface displays: \r\n* The current septicycle \r\n* The current checkpoint out of 35 \r\n* A countdown to the next checkpoint \r\n* The current time (24h format) \r\n* Bluetooth status \r\n* Watch Battery Level (and charge status) \r\n* Ingress Scoring Region you are currently in (AM01-KILO-02, for example) \r\n* The next 3 checkpoints \r\n* And most importantly, the Resistance Key! \r\n\r\nAll times displayed are in the timezone of your handset.
