The spark core is connected to various sensors, relays and coffee makers....\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n\r\n**Occupancy**- I connected spark core pins A0-A05 to four motion sensors and two reed switches. \r\nNow I'm able to track motion around my house and instantly know if doors are opened or closed just by looking at my watch. \r\n\r\n**Lights**- I connected spark core pins D0-D2 to relays that switch on/off three outdoor lights. These can now be controlled via my watch instead of having to go downstairs and operate them manually.\r\n\r\n**Garage Doors**- I've connected pins D3 and D4 to my garage door openers' switches. I'm now able to open/close both of my garage doors from anywhere, just using my watch.\r\n\r\n**Coffee** - I've connected pins D5 and D6 to the switches that operate my coffee machines. I've also created an in-app timer. So now I can not only brew coffee from anywhere, I can tell how fresh it is.\r\n\r\n**Drone** - Since most drones have their own restful API, I'm able to control drones using this same app. This part is still in development.\r\n\r\nThere is plenty of customization possible. If you would like this app customized for you, please contact it's maker at GuruNYC.com","developer_id":"5584f2596b9455602a000067","header_images":[{"orig":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/eaDXejWT6GKAatmwTFJ0/convert?cache=true&fit=crop","720x320":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/eaDXejWT6GKAatmwTFJ0/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=720&h=320"}],"hearts":22,"icon_image":{"28x28":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/n1GW4X5lRZS1Hi2OGXoh/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=28&h=28","48x48":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/n1GW4X5lRZS1Hi2OGXoh/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=48&h=48"},"id":"55b6825a2448b3ecb3000080","latest_release":{"id":"55b6b9615e07167c5f000098","js_md5":"ed0c3eead8f2b88a2e305cd7ee62f11a","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/94KfDsmgQHS4k8p1ebJQ","published_date":"2015-07-27T23:06:22.773Z","release_notes":"","version":"1.11"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55b6825a2448b3ecb3000080/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55b6825a2448b3ecb3000080/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55b6825a2448b3ecb3000080/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55b6825a2448b3ecb3000080/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55b6825a2448b3ecb3000080/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55b6825a2448b3ecb3000080/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/55b6825a2448b3ecb3000080"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/GT9m83rvQXW8Bk77o1Zn/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/GT9m83rvQXW8Bk77o1Zn/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-07-27T20:12:22.826Z","screenshot_hardware":"aplite","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/MzeyWQ24R9T5XPpChzWA/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"IoT Control Watch","type":"watchapp","uuid":"665500e5-7b52-4da4-bf14-c3fdb20107a4","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
