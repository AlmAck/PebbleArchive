It's my first attempt at an app so please email me at denisfinnegan@gmail.com with any issues. This app pulls Today, Tomorrow, 3 day Outlook and regional weather forecasts. I would like to acknowledge that this data comes from the Met.ie website but as the website currently has no RSS feed nor app for the pebble available, I hope they will acknowledge the public service I have done them by making their data available to Pebble users."}],"companions":{"ios":null,"android":null},"compatibility":{"ios":{"supported":true,"min_js_version":24},"android":{"supported":true},"aplite":{"supported":true,"firmware":{"major":3}},"basalt":{"supported":true,"firmware":{"major":3}},"chalk":{"supported":false,"firmware":{"major":3}},"diorite":{"supported":true,"firmware":{"major":3}},"emery":{"supported":true,"firmware":{"major":3}}},"created_at":"2014-12-30T23:20:33.255Z","description":"Simple Irish Weather App that shows you Today, Tomorrow & the 3 Day Outlook for Ireland; as well as regional weather.
