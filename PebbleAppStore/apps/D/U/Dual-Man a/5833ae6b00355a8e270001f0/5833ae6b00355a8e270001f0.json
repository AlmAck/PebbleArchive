On the other hand, no seconds (boring!) means 1 redraw per minute. Well, Custom Update-Rate means you can set the update rate to every 1,2,3,4,5,10,15,20,30 or 60 seconds.\r\n\r\nMoreover, DUAL Custom Update-Rate System means that you can set a different (slower) update rate at NIGHT. It can be set to 1,2,3,4,5,10,15 or 20 MINUTES. Let's face it again, at 3:12:07 AM, when you are half asleep you rather want to read a friendlier 3:10 (so, let your pebble sleep more when you sleep).\r\n\r\nDual-Manía goes further, you can have:\r\n- 12h, or 24h, or BOTH.\r\n- Hours can be shown with a hand, or an AM/PM indicator, or BOTH.\r\n- Mins can be shown with a hand, or a number, or BOTH.\r\n- Secs can be shown with a hand, or a number, or BOTH.\r\n- The face shape can be Round, or Square, or BOTH (regardless the shape of your screen).\r\n- The date can be abbreviated, or fully expanded, or BOTH.\r\n- It also has FULL DUAL location (English/Español), although dates can be displayed in your chosen language.\r\n- You can select to display any number of labels, ticks, complications,...etc, letting you tailor the look of your display from minimalist, to maximalist, and any thing in between.\r\n\r\nDual-Manía, the most customizable face ever!\r\nIt's FREE, so enjoy it and HEART ❤ it!","developer_id":"5327d89581f6bae5f00000b5","header_images":"","hearts":34,"id":"5833ae6b00355a8e270001f0","latest_release":{"id":"5837904d00355a2f3a000369","js_md5":"7de6908a6c5d7d814e82a23fbcb07e34","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/4Ilq4T0gSQqcVyPvUZSj","published_date":"2016-11-25T01:15:01.420Z","release_notes":"Show Bluetooth connection status in the face center as a check mark or as a cross, if it is connected or disconnected, accordingly.","version":"1.0"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5833ae6b00355a8e270001f0/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5833ae6b00355a8e270001f0/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5833ae6b00355a8e270001f0/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5833ae6b00355a8e270001f0/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5833ae6b00355a8e270001f0/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5833ae6b00355a8e270001f0/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/5833ae6b00355a8e270001f0"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/eCvK2d4CRFine8OIAqUg/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/eCvK2d4CRFine8OIAqUg/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2016-11-24T18:37:09.457Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/eCvK2d4CRFine8OIAqUg/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/SFMXnUI6RbG3V90qOBvc/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/3d8gDBJSIGPwro3URVyB/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/hAfKuRAmo6ZOpswENQw1/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/XFX0eP3XTuQD4J0VgxDU/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"Dual-Manía","type":"watchface","uuid":"3b167117-3314-497a-b6f1-db782dc3b706","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
