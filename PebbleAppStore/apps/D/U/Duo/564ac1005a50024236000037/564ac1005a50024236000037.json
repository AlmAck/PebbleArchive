In 12 hour mode, a PM symbol appears near the center in the bottom right quadrant (this also appears in analog mode).\r\n\r\nAnalog mode, is harder to read.  The hour “hand” is set closer to the center of the watch face and the 00-55 Minute “hand” is furthest away. Both hands are slightly curved, with the exception of the 12, 3, 6,& 9 hours which are displayed as straight lines. Single minutes are located in the middle as 4 small straight vertical bars.\r\n\r\nA shake of the wrist brings up the date mode for a few seconds.   This can be shown in DD/MM or MM/DD format by configuration.  A date symbol appears near the center in the top left quadrant.\r\n\r\nConfiguration option gives a choice of colors for foreground and background on the settings screen.   If same color is chosen for both, watchface converts foreground to black or white to ensure it still shows.\r\n\r\n  \r\nScreenshots show:  \r\n(1)   6:59AM (digital)\r\n(2)   3:19AM (analog)\r\n(3) 10:11PM (analog)  \r\n(4) September 22 (date mode, DDMM)\r\n(5) 10:01PM (digital)\r\n\r\nThis watchface design was created by Justin Schofield, from the UK, and is published with the designer's permission.
