You'll also get a notification whenever you're near an unphotographed location that is new to you.\r\n\r\nDiderot uses the articles-by-lat-lon-without-images tool on wmflabs.org to find unphotographed articles. Only articles with .jpg images — not .png or .svg illustrations — count as illustrated, so you can photograph places that have only maps or diagrams.\r\n\r\nYour location data updates every minute from your phone's geolocation.","developer_id":"57801d326c21044501000e1d","header_images":"","hearts":3,"id":"57dc94602a6ea665510000f0","latest_release":{"id":"58262a1ab62cef84a200017f","js_md5":"6b9e4951b7f8815ad4d4c7584a26c320","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/CmXNZYK2ThaxjtPQVS5a","published_date":"2016-11-11T20:36:00.275Z","release_notes":"1.3: Customizable time color, Wikidata fallback\r\n  - You can choose the color of the time text in the settings.\r\n  - If no unillustrated Wikipedia articles are found nearby, it will try a query on Wikidata instead.","version":"1.3"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57dc94602a6ea665510000f0/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57dc94602a6ea665510000f0/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57dc94602a6ea665510000f0/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57dc94602a6ea665510000f0/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57dc94602a6ea665510000f0/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57dc94602a6ea665510000f0/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/57dc94602a6ea665510000f0"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/aHukAsftQjOZWCgHR8Z3/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/aHukAsftQjOZWCgHR8Z3/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2016-09-17T01:29:57.655Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/aHukAsftQjOZWCgHR8Z3/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/AAJBNdScS8WoBOok703i/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"https://github.com/ragesoss/diderot","title":"Diderot","type":"watchface","uuid":"752681f3-e884-4ab9-90fe-aa29ea29bb1a","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
