I'm DiverseCity in Minecraft and I made an awesome watch face with a bluetooth status reader and a battery gauge. This watch face displays seconds, too. When it is disconnected and reconnected to Bluetooth, it will buzz. I originally made this watch face just for myself, but I liked it so much I decided I would share it so that you could check it out too. If you like it please give a heart, it means a lot to me. <3","developer_id":"55be4aa1ed43b8b07e000057","header_images":"","hearts":2,"id":"55bffab506d9562fb2000082","latest_release":{"id":"55bffc2306d956f81200007e","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/NnJAP3eESxqjaDKWogNq","published_date":"2015-08-03T23:42:22.265Z","release_notes":"Release 1.0","version":"1.0"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55bffab506d9562fb2000082/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55bffab506d9562fb2000082/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55bffab506d9562fb2000082/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55bffab506d9562fb2000082/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55bffab506d9562fb2000082/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55bffab506d9562fb2000082/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/55bffab506d9562fb2000082"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/6H1wtOKcQwaMDT540Q3I/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/6H1wtOKcQwaMDT540Q3I/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-08-03T23:54:57.728Z","screenshot_hardware":"aplite","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/6H1wtOKcQwaMDT540Q3I/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"DiverseCity Minecraft","type":"watchface","uuid":"13371337-4c42-4aae-aa60-0faa870ea51e","website":"http://www.wf-g.de/wf/20150804/diversecity/"}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
