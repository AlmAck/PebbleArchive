The word \"DiverseCity\" was removed and in it's place the date was inserted. The bluetooth status indicator was moved downward slightly to accommodate the changes.\r\n\r\n\r\nHi! I'm DiverseCity in Minecraft and I made an awesome watch face with a bluetooth status reader and a battery gauge. This watch face displays seconds, too. When it is disconnected and reconnected to Bluetooth, it will buzz. I originally made this watch face just for myself, but I liked it so much I decided I would share it so that you could check it out too. If you like it please give a heart, it means a lot to me. <3","developer_id":"55be4aa1ed43b8b07e000057","header_images":"","hearts":6,"id":"55f108663b8c851f4100004f","latest_release":{"id":"55f10907ee4ee4a925000048","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/5xRv2lQjQ2ycjhSXK0hm","published_date":"2015-09-10T04:37:48.588Z","release_notes":"","version":"1.0"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55f108663b8c851f4100004f/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55f108663b8c851f4100004f/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55f108663b8c851f4100004f/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55f108663b8c851f4100004f/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55f108663b8c851f4100004f/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55f108663b8c851f4100004f/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/55f108663b8c851f4100004f"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/f590uMqkQlOa9xNueivd/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/f590uMqkQlOa9xNueivd/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-09-10T04:37:54.480Z","screenshot_hardware":"aplite","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/f590uMqkQlOa9xNueivd/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"DiverseCity Minecraft (With date)","type":"watchface","uuid":"13371337-1d4b-41d0-a23c-41034347980a","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
