The two outer digits are the hours and the smaller inner two are the minutes. \r\nThe digits are different colors to make it easier to read: 10-hours in green, single hours in yellow, 10-minutes in red and single minutes in blue. \r\n\r\nThe simple cryptic display should appeal to people who like things that are a bit different, but is still recognisable to the more conservative.\r\n\r\nTime will display in 12-hour or 24-hour mode, depending on the watch setting.\r\n\r\nThe screenshot examples show:  \r\n (1) 08:52\r\n (2) 09:36\r\n (3) 23:57 (24-hour mode)\r\n\r\nDesign created by Peter Fletcher and originally appeared on the Tokyoflash Design Studio.
