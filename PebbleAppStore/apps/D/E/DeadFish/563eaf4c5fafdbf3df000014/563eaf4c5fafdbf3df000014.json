It was released under public domain and was originally programmed in C, but now it has been since ported to many other programming languages.\r\n\r\nDeadfish has a way to output things but it has no way to input them! It has only a few commands, only four in total. \r\n\r\n- Press \"Up\" for the \"i\" command (increment accumulator)\r\n- Press \"Down\" for the \"d\" command (decrement accumulator)\r\n- Press \"Select\" for the \"s\" command (square accumulator)\r\n- Press \"Back\" for the \"o\" command (output accumulator)\r\n\r\nAdditionaly you may also:\r\n- Long press \"Select\" to delete your program \r\n- Long press \"Back\" to exit the application\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the Deadfish website for more details about programming in Deadfish: http://esolangs.org/wiki/deadfish\r\n\r\n‚ù§ Give us a heart if you like Deadfish!\r\n\r\nThe Deadfish logo comes from clker.com.\r\nWe are NOT affiliated with Jonathan Todd Skinner, esolangs.org nor clker.com","developer_id":"531fa4eb0f3ef748ea000013","header_images":"","hearts":6,"icon_image":{"28x28":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/TC4K43ejTrGpgfhRqdGo/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=28&h=28","48x48":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/TC4K43ejTrGpgfhRqdGo/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=48&h=48"},"id":"563eaf4c5fafdbf3df000014","latest_release":{"id":"563ec190dd7c5d026b000015","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/VbpoMdSCmDkCOndhT4Lw","published_date":"2015-11-08T03:29:33.389Z","release_notes":"Force Aplite to use 32 bits integer because of the lack of support for %llu in SDK2","version":"1.1"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/563eaf4c5fafdbf3df000014/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/563eaf4c5fafdbf3df000014/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/563eaf4c5fafdbf3df000014/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/563eaf4c5fafdbf3df000014/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/563eaf4c5fafdbf3df000014/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/563eaf4c5fafdbf3df000014/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/563eaf4c5fafdbf3df000014"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/IlcGWFdSeCFAyp0LkobV/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/IlcGWFdSeCFAyp0LkobV/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-11-08T02:29:45.641Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/nTdy4OB4SE6o0cmuWTUQ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"https://github.com/LeFauve/Deadfish-for-Pebble","title":"DeadFish","type":"watchapp","uuid":"7b9166de-f309-4a55-b3fe-a423a4911b43","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
