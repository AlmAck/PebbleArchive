Assign an exercise to each of the four suits and then do the number shown on each card, with face cards representing 10 (or higher if you prefer a stronger challenge). After each set of eight cards, you'll be prompted to alternate exercises, at which point you can also insert additional exercises as you see fit.  As the cards are random, each workout is slightly different.\r\n\r\nExample workout:\r\n------------------------\r\nSpades: Push-ups\r\nClubs: Leg Lifts\r\nDiamonds: Burpees\r\nHearts: Squats\r\n\r\nInterval Exercise: 200 yd.
