Exact time is shown by analog hour hand only. Additional feature is the display of the current Moon phase. The watchface shows a single hour hand only. Midnight is on bottom of the clockface while Noon is indicated on top. One rotation of the hour hand takes a whole day. An indicator for the seconds is blinking on bottom of the watchface. If holding the Pebble watch parallel over ground and turning it so the hour hand is pointing towards the sun then top of the watch face will always point in north direction and bottom of watch face in south direction on southern hemisphere (Compass feature). Additionally the current Moon phase is shown with more convenience for observers of southern hemisphere. Moon phase display is expected to work until end of Unix Time (overflow on Jan 19th, 2038 03:14:07 GMT) at least as implemented here.","developer_id":"55592fc6b038d44f9e00003e","header_images":"","hearts":11,"id":"5573b7db788211edc60000c2","latest_release":{"id":"5573bafb7d6f3d40fd0000e7","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/QF9WWDwmSRKENox2Xoo2","published_date":"2016-03-26T18:30:07.843Z","release_notes":"Here the current Moon phase is shown with more convenience for observers of southern hemisphere.\r\n\r\nIf holding the Pebble watch parallel over ground and turning it so the hour hand is pointing towards the sun then top of the watch face will always point in north direction and bottom of watch face in south direction on southern hemisphere (Compass feature).\r\n\r\nMind the observer's orientation and location: The compass feature is basically depending on the user's (or better the observer's) orientation and position on Earth - respectively the latitude of the observing position.
