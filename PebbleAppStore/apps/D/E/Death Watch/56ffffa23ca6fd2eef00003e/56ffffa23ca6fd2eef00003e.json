I made the textures for this watchface, and please, like to heal my hand. I spent around 2 hours making all the pixels to make this watch face and now my hands hurt so bad! ;-; I made the textures in the Microsoft program paint so it was pixel by pixel. For the most part it is black and white but does contain note book colors if your on pebble time and not regular pebble aplite. This is mainly made for Basalt because the pixel amount is larger! Please like!\r\n\r\nTags:\r\ncool color black and white death note watchface watch face basalt aplite original paint program hurt lol meme death note death watch swag ","developer_id":"549c0abd0544722d37000293","header_images":"","hearts":11,"id":"56ffffa23ca6fd2eef00003e","latest_release":{"id":"5700012edf95c52bce000047","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/jkveVAqaRXi14Kn7cUtX","published_date":"2016-04-02T17:33:11.190Z","release_notes":"","version":"1.0"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56ffffa23ca6fd2eef00003e/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56ffffa23ca6fd2eef00003e/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56ffffa23ca6fd2eef00003e/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56ffffa23ca6fd2eef00003e/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56ffffa23ca6fd2eef00003e/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56ffffa23ca6fd2eef00003e/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/56ffffa23ca6fd2eef00003e"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/MV1eUsGpQxsZS7FvfELY/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/MV1eUsGpQxsZS7FvfELY/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2016-04-02T17:33:13.253Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/MV1eUsGpQxsZS7FvfELY/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"http://instagram.com/L_FBI/","title":"Death Watch","type":"watchface","uuid":"13371337-d7c1-42a3-a8c3-57b223eb65e6","website":"http://instagram.com/Russian_otter/"}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
