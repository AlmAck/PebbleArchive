Since decimal time has no practical use other than being an oddity, in the settings, you can have the real time shown in 12 or 24 hr format. Also, in settings you can turn seconds off. Also, you will notice that the decimal time seconds often seem to skip. That is because one decimal second is actually a fraction (0.864) of a normal second and the clock is only updated every normal second.","developer_id":"531a21865af660f5fd00034f","hearts":7,"id":"54a2d4325c486f01df0000f0","latest_release":{"id":"54a2d4a285047c08630000cf","js_md5":"4b8c0e54cf0d63c25212cf4fac33482f","js_version":24,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/LrsrcQjS3qfX9Yh8AhC9","published_date":"2014-12-30T17:27:51.758Z","release_notes":"First Release\r\n    -The bones but not the makeup","version":"1.0"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54a2d4325c486f01df0000f0/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54a2d4325c486f01df0000f0/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54a2d4325c486f01df0000f0/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54a2d4325c486f01df0000f0/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54a2d4325c486f01df0000f0/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54a2d4325c486f01df0000f0/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/54a2d4325c486f01df0000f0"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/2H46bEEQRNO7CYyQ48Qi/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/2H46bEEQRNO7CYyQ48Qi/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2014-12-30T17:28:00.846Z","screenshot_hardware":"aplite","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/2H46bEEQRNO7CYyQ48Qi/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/Ootv8FcRtAuPahkYB6fA/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/QP1mPGh0Ry6MsUnEyaup/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/FeibE3YQdGuAFIxz2HVA/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"https://github.com/dewguzzler/Decimal.time","title":"Decimal.Time","type":"watchface","uuid":"aa526a4a-137b-4bb9-94fd-50182c33dfd0","website":"http://dewguzzler.github.io/"}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
