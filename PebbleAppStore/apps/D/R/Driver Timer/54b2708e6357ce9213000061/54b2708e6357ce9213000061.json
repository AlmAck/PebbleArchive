It should also be compatible with other countries that adhere to the EU Driving Laws.\r\n\r\nAs of version 1.1, the application now supports EU domestic rules too for van drivers etc. This option can be enabled in the settings page.\r\n\r\nThis app is very basic and only keeps track of driving hours on a daily basis. It has vibration alerts for when you are getting close to approaching your driving rest periods.\r\n\r\nI made this app as part of my dissertation project for my university degree and I would appreciate any and all feedback.
