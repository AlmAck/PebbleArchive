Remember to heart it!\r\n\r\nSimple watch design with current local temperature (updated every 10 minutes). \r\n\r\nThis watch was based on the \"Simplicity\" watchface included by default. It is meant to be as simple as possible, but still provide whatever features it can. Current features:\r\n• Temperature is automatically retrieved based on current location (can be overridden from settings)\r\n• Weather data is stored and used for up to 30 minutes when switching away from watchface\r\n• Units (Celsius or Fahrenheit) are based on current country\r\n• Currently the following use Fahrenheit: Bahamas, Belize, the Cayman Islands, Palau, and the United States\r\n• Icon and vibrate to notify you when bluetooth is disconnected (No need to clutter the screen when everything is fine, right?)\r\n\r\nFeatures I plan to add:\r\nConfiguration:\r\n• Optionally add line separating time/date\r\n• Units override (mainly for those traveling)\r\n• Optionally have icon when bluetooth is connected\r\n• Optionally display battery level\r\n• Optionally display icons indicating weather conditions (rain, snow, thunder etc...)\r\n\r\nIf you find any bugs, or want certain features added, please don't hesitate to contact me so I can prioritize it.","developer_id":"55ecdd8f4fcd1cdeeb000067","header_images":"","hearts":17,"id":"55ed039a4fcd1cbec2000071","latest_release":{"id":"574316dbb481847efd00000a","js_md5":"47338efe386bc03a3b62f373ab7a016f","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/TExcZv4KQMmMM4ctvOsz","published_date":"2016-05-23T14:43:01.880Z","release_notes":"Should no longer crash","version":"2.5"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55ed039a4fcd1cbec2000071/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55ed039a4fcd1cbec2000071/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55ed039a4fcd1cbec2000071/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55ed039a4fcd1cbec2000071/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55ed039a4fcd1cbec2000071/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55ed039a4fcd1cbec2000071/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/55ed039a4fcd1cbec2000071"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/zBLL8tKYQVK6uv7FAYc2/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/zBLL8tKYQVK6uv7FAYc2/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-09-08T01:15:47.161Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/zBLL8tKYQVK6uv7FAYc2/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"sWeather","type":"watchface","uuid":"355cf1da-efcb-498b-93ac-4180379e83bd","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
