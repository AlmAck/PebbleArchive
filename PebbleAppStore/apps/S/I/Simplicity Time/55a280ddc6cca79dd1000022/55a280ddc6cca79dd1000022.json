It tells you the time in big, bold lettering, and it also displays today's date in two different easy-to-read formats. It also brings some color into your life.\r\n\r\nSimple Time is designed to be a casual watch face that's easy to glance at with minimal effort just to read the time. It also allows, if you look a little closer, the reader to get some more details about the time and date. For the Pebble Time, it also adds a little splash of color to your day.","developer_id":"54d03817699bce3234000059","header_images":"","hearts":7,"id":"55a280ddc6cca79dd1000022","latest_release":{"id":"55a5779986f0151d9b00005c","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/awOTFCMfR6ePrHfMioDx","published_date":"2015-07-14T20:57:25.872Z","release_notes":"SimpleTime has been changed to \"Simplicity Time\".\r\n\r\nv2r2 (ver2.1) includes the following changes:\r\n\r\nMenu image, Minor bug fix, name change.","version":"2.1"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55a280ddc6cca79dd1000022/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55a280ddc6cca79dd1000022/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55a280ddc6cca79dd1000022/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55a280ddc6cca79dd1000022/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55a280ddc6cca79dd1000022/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55a280ddc6cca79dd1000022/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/55a280ddc6cca79dd1000022"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/2YFnx4ERHWA5IYRLZilt/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/2YFnx4ERHWA5IYRLZilt/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-07-14T20:57:29.040Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/2YFnx4ERHWA5IYRLZilt/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/owr6sAWdQvSp5iqAbaJP/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/Kz6037S0SFOnIcdjDwnA/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"https://github.com/brennan-macaig/SimpleTime","title":"Simplicity Time","type":"watchface","uuid":"f735bc7c-2a20-49f3-b30c-75a350b97089","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
