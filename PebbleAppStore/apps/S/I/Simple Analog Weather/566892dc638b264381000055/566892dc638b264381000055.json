Future versions will allow you to turn that off in Settings.\r\n\r\nOptional weather from Weather Underground!\r\n\r\nA simple analog watchface that gets weather every 15 minutes, on the quarter hour. The default weather source is OpenWeatherMap but if you get a free API key from Weather Underground the weather data will come from there. Simply go to http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/d/pricing. Please email me if you have any trouble.\r\n\r\nThe green/red bar shows the battery level. A double-vibration and bluetooth icon indicate a disconnect.\r\n\r\nYou will need to have Location services enabled on your phone or else the weather will never load because it doesn't know where you are. The temperature is now available in either Fahrenheit or Celsius and can be changed on the Settings page.\r\n\r\nFuture versions will be more customizable.\r\n\r\nPlease give a Heart if you like the watch, and email me at the Developer link below with issues, comments and suggestions!","developer_id":"545f542cf520d9e448000057","header_images":"","hearts":100,"id":"566892dc638b264381000055","latest_release":{"id":"570fc010e66231462000001c","js_md5":"4401fab341b220c4a6066b491e6852ff","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/fSvpr9iLSYOOk4xMGM5q","published_date":"2016-04-14T16:06:51.165Z","release_notes":"Bug fixes.\r\nRemoved \"Loading...\" text from weather.","version":"1.14"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/566892dc638b264381000055/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/566892dc638b264381000055/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/566892dc638b264381000055/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/566892dc638b264381000055/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/566892dc638b264381000055/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/566892dc638b264381000055/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/566892dc638b264381000055"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/NqGh3AiRXmAFXM6OEnTY/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/NqGh3AiRXmAFXM6OEnTY/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-12-09T21:00:46.348Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/NqGh3AiRXmAFXM6OEnTY/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/F0bZIwlPTmqHk2qu2HVS/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"Simple Analog Weather","type":"watchface","uuid":"a4e5a9e3-6f6f-41f7-be34-b1445f09099f","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
