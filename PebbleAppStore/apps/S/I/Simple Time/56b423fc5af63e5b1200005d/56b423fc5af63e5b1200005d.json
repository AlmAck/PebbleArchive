When you hit your goal, the step count will turn a color of your choice (working on adding an optional vibration, too). Not a feature you want? Totally fine! Just leave the slider at 0 (the default) and it'll be just like always.\r\n\r\nWeather Update Frequency!\r\nWant to save battery? Fetching weather frequently can decrease it quickly, so I've added a slider to adjust how frequently it updates the weather, between once every 5 minutes and once per hour.

Yes, now you can change both the background AND text colors! The future is now!\r\nMore options! The battery bar can now be either colorful (classic), or solid (black or white, depending on your screen color). Love a green background? Make the battery bar visible by switching it to solid mode!\r\nIn the same vein, you can now choose either a black or white Bluetooth Disconnect icon!\r\n24 hour time and Celsius continue to work. I'll be adding more in the coming weeks so stay tuned! Have a feature request?
