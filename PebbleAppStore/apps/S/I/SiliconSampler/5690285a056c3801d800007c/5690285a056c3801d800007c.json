You can find the time in the middle (only 24h format supported, this is part of the \"design\"). You can read different informations below the time depending on the hour:\r\n - from 22 till morning 7, you can read the battery so you can decide, whether to charge Pebble or not before you are going to sleep or leave the house\r\n - between 7-8, between 12-13 and between 18-22, you will find the current date in \"yyyy MMM dd\" format as this time is spent with moving from home to work, this can be useful in these hours\r\n - in the rest of the day, the weekday, the current date and the state of battery information is rotated in every minute\r\n\r\nThis distribution is currently for experiment. Later on you should be able to set these from the settings.\r\n\r\nSupported language: English","developer_id":"5572b4f83b1d516f79000011","header_images":"","hearts":13,"id":"5690285a056c3801d800007c","latest_release":{"id":"569029fb01743abfb100009d","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/Uaay6GOwQtmgaSQXgFXD","published_date":"2016-01-08T21:49:56.303Z","release_notes":"v1.0","version":"1.0"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5690285a056c3801d800007c/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5690285a056c3801d800007c/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5690285a056c3801d800007c/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5690285a056c3801d800007c/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5690285a056c3801d800007c/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5690285a056c3801d800007c/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/5690285a056c3801d800007c"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/VQFXMagS3ZmhHxwuS67g/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/VQFXMagS3ZmhHxwuS67g/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2016-01-08T22:06:08.822Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/VQFXMagS3ZmhHxwuS67g/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/ZstSs5wETMaxQ7jWd0Pq/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/NyNkozEjTSpBDWAPbiuw/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/uQHvH82dRQCgXzZ0bbln/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"https://github.com/WiesnerPeti/SiliconSampler","title":"SiliconSampler","type":"watchface","uuid":"e0899a62-c6ce-4e77-9a6d-b583a555a851","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
