The SimpleTrek watchface is merely a simplified version of Adam C's excellent and more functional STARGAZE watchface which, itself, is built upon Chris Lewis's most excellent STARFIELD SMOOTH watchface and whose source code and hard work I mercilessly and minutely repurposed for this.\r\n\r\nSeriously though, you should definitely check the STARGAZE and STARFIELD SMOOTH watchfaces by putting those in the Pebble AppStore search bar right now. They're awesome.","developer_id":"540049a77b274e86430000f8","header_images":"","hearts":18,"id":"558ad74d45b539de800000c9","latest_release":{"id":"558ae27745b5393cdf0000b6","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/PHACY4NpQYCsNywMsNHk","published_date":"2015-06-24T17:06:11.541Z","release_notes":"","version":"1.1"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/558ad74d45b539de800000c9/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/558ad74d45b539de800000c9/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/558ad74d45b539de800000c9/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/558ad74d45b539de800000c9/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/558ad74d45b539de800000c9/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/558ad74d45b539de800000c9/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/558ad74d45b539de800000c9"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/DCDqvxhpT6Sv8GHjuJNf/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/DCDqvxhpT6Sv8GHjuJNf/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-06-24T17:18:17.303Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/DCDqvxhpT6Sv8GHjuJNf/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"SimpleTrek","type":"watchface","uuid":"3825e225-a35d-49d2-b8bf-b422dde53156","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
