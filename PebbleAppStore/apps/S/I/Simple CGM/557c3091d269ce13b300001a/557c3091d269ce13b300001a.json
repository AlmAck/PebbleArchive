THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. The watchface requires active use of the Share receiver with the Dexcom Share2 iOS application sending data to their cloud service. This watchface is both Time and Original Pebble compatible. After installation, you must open the settings for the watchface from within the Pebble smartphone app. SELECT “Share” as the mode. The other two options are not supported/functioning. ENTER your Dexcom account information. The username is not typically an email address, and can be found by opening the Share2 iOS app and tapping “Account.” NOTE: mmol/l has not been thoroughly tested, as Share is still US only. Set your High & Low Thresholds Set your Vibration type: “New & Alerts” will vibe for every new BG read (double vibe) and any new BG in the Alert ranges. “Alerts Only” will long vibe for each BG in the Alert ranges. There is no snooze option yet, so it will vibrate every 5 minutes if within the ranges. Click “Submit” The watchface will let you know if you have the account info wrong. For Time: out range High will show Yellow (circle) color, Low will be Red, in range is Green. For Original: out range High will show Black (circle) color as will Low, in range is a White circle (black text). SOME NOTES ON COMM ERROR: Comm Errors are specific to communication between the watch and the phone app. These occur when the watch face or the smartphone Pebble app isn’t functioning properly, or the Bluetooth messaging between them is failing. If the internet connection is down or causing the issue, you should see “net error” in the circle (where the BG delta usually is) and the BG will be blanked out. For comm errors: I open the pebble smartphone app, force quit and relaunch, cycle watchface. If it didn’t work: I turn Bluetooth off (on the phone), and back on again (airplane mode off and on does the trick too), force quit pebble app and relaunch. Cycle watchface. Still no luck? Power cycle both devices, relaunch pebble app after both are back and ready. Net errors: try your web browser, does it browse to websites? Try a website you never go to to verify you’re not hitting a cached site. On wifi? Turn it off and try on cellular only."},{"version":"1.5","published_date":"2015-07-19T20:05:53.992Z","release_notes":"NEW for 1.5: Pebble Time now shows date & time as a string above BG info.\r\n\r\nSimple CGM MUST NOT BE USED TO MAKE MEDICAL DECISIONS.
