If you want to know the best time to work, rest and eat - look at the sun.\"\r\n\r\nThis watchface is intended to help you align your daily actitvities and circadian rhythm with natural solar cycle.\r\n\r\nWhat it does:\r\n1) uses your phones location services to retrieve your current location,\r\n2) calculates sunrise, sunset and local true solar time for your location,\r\n3) displays both Solar time (in the upper part) and Clock time (in the lower part),\r\n4) displays position of the Sun as a watch hand,\r\n5) displays duration of night and day as a black and white background (in solar time scale),\r\n6) displays your local sunrise and sunset time (in clock time).\r\n\r\nIt automatically tries to check your location and recalculate sun data every 30 minutes. If location services are not available, it uses last known location.\r\n\r\nIf you find it useful, please consider dropping a bit or two to bitcoin:18QcovzwPmxiEp4Vr9CQCd4MNstugi8ZGu.
