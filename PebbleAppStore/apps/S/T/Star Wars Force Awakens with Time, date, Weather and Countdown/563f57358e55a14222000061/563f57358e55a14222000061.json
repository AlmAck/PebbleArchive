This watchface includes the countdown to the number of days before the Force Awakens is released on December 17th 2015.  It shows the Time, Date, Weather (if you are in the US it displays as Fahrenheit, otherwise as Celsius) and Battery (as a percentage until it reaches below 20% and then states Use the Force).  I hope you like this as an alternative to the animated image and to include the weather as well.
