(Step counting even works for pebble classic!!)\r\n\r\nThe watchface is designed for those who sit at a desk all day and need that reminder to get up and move around. (Sitting to long isn't good and having the indicators of how much I have moved resonantly really helps motivate me to get up and move around.) It is also designed to let you know what temperature it is outside and when you level your phone behind by buzzing when you lose connection to your phone. \r\n\r\nHope you enjoy!
