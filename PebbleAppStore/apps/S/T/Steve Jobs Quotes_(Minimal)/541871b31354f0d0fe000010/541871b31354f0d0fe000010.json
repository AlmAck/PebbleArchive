Don't be trapped by dogma - which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of other's opinions drown out your own inner voice.

Everything else is secondary.\r\n\r\nSteve Jobs","developer_id":"5415af3196fc8005b2000145","hearts":8,"id":"541871b31354f0d0fe000010","latest_release":{"id":"541871c19c8c02d9670000a8","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/mDtkZM5HTICsVgZ5ZbuO","published_date":"2014-09-16T17:22:16.744Z","release_notes":"Initial Release","version":"1.0"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/541871b31354f0d0fe000010/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/541871b31354f0d0fe000010/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/541871b31354f0d0fe000010/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/541871b31354f0d0fe000010/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/541871b31354f0d0fe000010/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/541871b31354f0d0fe000010/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/541871b31354f0d0fe000010"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/J2NLdkX3R0KohctMAtWD/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/J2NLdkX3R0KohctMAtWD/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2014-09-16T17:23:04.351Z","screenshot_hardware":"aplite","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/J2NLdkX3R0KohctMAtWD/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"Steve Jobs Quotes_(Minimal)","type":"watchface","uuid":"13371337-ca64-4e0d-a424-a024f1899bce","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
