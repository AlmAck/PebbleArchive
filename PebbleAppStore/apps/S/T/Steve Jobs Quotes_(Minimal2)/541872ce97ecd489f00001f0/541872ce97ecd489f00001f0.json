Don't be trapped by dogma - which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of other's opinions drown out your own inner voice.

Everything else is secondary.\r\n\r\nSteve Jobs","developer_id":"5415af3196fc8005b2000145","hearts":17,"id":"541872ce97ecd489f00001f0","latest_release":{"id":"541872d9a0fd4ab01e00001c","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/pZPCtAVoTmSGklS032wz","published_date":"2014-09-16T17:26:54.739Z","release_notes":"Initial Release","version":"1.0"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/541872ce97ecd489f00001f0/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/541872ce97ecd489f00001f0/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/541872ce97ecd489f00001f0/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/541872ce97ecd489f00001f0/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/541872ce97ecd489f00001f0/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/541872ce97ecd489f00001f0/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/541872ce97ecd489f00001f0"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/lyu23WF0QmKIbPZCwfnM/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/lyu23WF0QmKIbPZCwfnM/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2014-09-16T17:26:58.163Z","screenshot_hardware":"aplite","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/lyu23WF0QmKIbPZCwfnM/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"Steve Jobs Quotes_(Minimal2)","type":"watchface","uuid":"13371337-f8a4-45e9-aee0-b7f1df0487b4","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
