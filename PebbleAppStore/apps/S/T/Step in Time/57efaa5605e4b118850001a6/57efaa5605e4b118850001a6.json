I checked and the variable is defined correctly, it simply isn't running correctly. I changed the way I am defining the variable in this version slightly hoping it will fix the issue"},{"version":"1.5","published_date":"2016-11-28T22:08:25.906Z","release_notes":"Sleep has been improved to display 8888 as the time when sleeping to be clearer that the display is intentionally not updating. Sleep is also now interrupt based so it takes less battery to check and sleeps deeper. Also added an option to disable sleep. Replaced the confusing manual sleep with IDLE, which is very similar to sleep except that it detects lack of movement for 30 minutes and goes to idle. Shake your wrist to wake up your watch or use the options in the pebble app to disable.  Enjoy"},{"version":"1.4","published_date":"2016-12-01T21:41:53.408Z","release_notes":"Small tweak to add a red circle color if you more than double your daily average steps/daily step goal."},{"version":"1.3","published_date":"2016-10-13T15:57:43.345Z","release_notes":"Saves 1k in resources by eliminating some floating point code, changed the battery icon to be larger and fixed an order of operations error when calculating the width of the power remaining (undererepresenting the remaining power)"},{"version":"1.2","published_date":"2016-10-12T16:25:09.439Z","release_notes":"Added 3 weather providers for current weather data, you can specify if the circle fills according to you daily average or you daily step goal, the watchface can now sleep to save battery, you can also change the text color."},{"version":"1.1","published_date":"2016-10-05T15:43:10.820Z","release_notes":"Sliders for step goals to reduce errors in user inputs"},{"version":"1.0","published_date":"2016-10-05T15:42:02.980Z","release_notes":"Basic functionality and configurable user defined goals"}],"companions":{"ios":null,"android":null},"compatibility":{"ios":{"supported":true,"min_js_version":-1},"android":{"supported":true},"aplite":{"supported":false,"firmware":{"major":3}},"basalt":{"supported":true,"firmware":{"major":3}},"chalk":{"supported":false,"firmware":{"major":3}},"diorite":{"supported":false,"firmware":{"major":3}},"emery":{"supported":true,"firmware":{"major":3}}},"created_at":"2016-10-01T12:21:42.823Z","description":"All: Idle and Sleep are fixed and obey the settings as I replaced the builtin app_timer functionality.  \r\n\r\nThis watchface is a reconstruction of the Strider watchface with some additional custom features.  I would love to have some help or your suggestions...shoot me an email from the support link.  \r\n\r\n-Set an mid day step goal as well as a day step goal, after you attain either of these goals your watch will buzz in a unique pattern and display which goal you met (top right of the screenshot).  The watchface will also buzz when you attain your average step goal for this day of the week over the last 4 weeks...ie the average daily steps of the last 4 Saturdays\r\n\r\n-The watch can sleep with you and display \"Watch is sleeping\" with the time \"...\" and stop refreshing time/weather to save power .  Flick your wrist to wake the watch early, or you can disable this in the settings.\r\n\r\n-The watch will go idle while you chill on the couch.  If it sees no significant movement for 45 minutes it will do the same thing as sleeping, flick your wrist to wake it up or just start walking.  Disable is available in options.\r\n\r\n-The watchface is weather enabled and refreshes every 30 minutes.  Current weather data is available from Wunderground, Forcast.io, and OpenWeatherMap and you will need to sign up at https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/d/docs, https://developer.forecast.io/, or http://openweathermap.org/appid to obtain a free API key.","developer_id":"564ba91d0fa9d91476000004","header_images":"","hearts":39,"id":"57efaa5605e4b118850001a6","latest_release":{"id":"5841c345ca3094044b000112","js_md5":"758400610edd5275e87533cf667b0b89","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/X0GJfqD8S1qhg0AEh5YF","published_date":"2016-12-02T18:54:23.399Z","release_notes":"So after some fustration on for everyone, I stopped using the pebble's app_timer function and wrote my own.
