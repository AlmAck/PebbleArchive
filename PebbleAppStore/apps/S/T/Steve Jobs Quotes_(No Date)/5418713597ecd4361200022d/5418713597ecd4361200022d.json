Don't be trapped by dogma - which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of other's opinions drown out your own inner voice.

Everything else is secondary.\r\n\r\nSteve Jobs","developer_id":"5415af3196fc8005b2000145","header_images":"","hearts":19,"id":"5418713597ecd4361200022d","latest_release":{"id":"54187145e2f3418ca2000020","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/IJRdCSTuAikXjC24nQGb","published_date":"2014-09-16T17:20:11.707Z","release_notes":"Initial Release","version":"1.0"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5418713597ecd4361200022d/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5418713597ecd4361200022d/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5418713597ecd4361200022d/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5418713597ecd4361200022d/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5418713597ecd4361200022d/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5418713597ecd4361200022d/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/5418713597ecd4361200022d"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/40yZKQ8SQ7yz8r1xptDL/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/40yZKQ8SQ7yz8r1xptDL/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-11-29T01:43:48.571Z","screenshot_hardware":"aplite","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/40yZKQ8SQ7yz8r1xptDL/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"Steve Jobs Quotes_(No Date)","type":"watchface","uuid":"13371337-e786-4a72-a0a7-2fc759b2dc53","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
