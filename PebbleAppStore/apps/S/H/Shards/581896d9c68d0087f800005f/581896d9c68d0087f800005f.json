The circle in center becomes thin and red (if display supports colors) as your battery drains. The second hand can be disabled for energy saving. Weather is updated twice an hour (not configurable yet). Weather source can be configured (OpenWeatherMap, WeatherUndeground or Yahoo). User can optionally specify own API key. Temperature units supported are metric and imperial. Color scheme can be configured.","developer_id":"531ae737c5f2c54076000094","header_images":"","hearts":22,"id":"581896d9c68d0087f800005f","latest_release":{"id":"5836f1bdca309442d9000146","js_md5":"b7d67f8b0afa6602b57dce97cbfff18a","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/gzrjdkARmaGoGL1nPv2R","published_date":"2016-11-24T13:57:53.091Z","release_notes":"Release 1.2\r\nAdded WeatherUndeground and Yahoo provider.\r\nUser can use personal API key for weather update.\r\nWeather doesn't disappear from watchface during updates.","version":"1.2"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/581896d9c68d0087f800005f/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/581896d9c68d0087f800005f/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/581896d9c68d0087f800005f/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/581896d9c68d0087f800005f/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/581896d9c68d0087f800005f/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/581896d9c68d0087f800005f/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/581896d9c68d0087f800005f"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/RtqegMfiSiGwOQonhgEc/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/RtqegMfiSiGwOQonhgEc/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2016-11-01T15:09:04.592Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/RtqegMfiSiGwOQonhgEc/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"https://github.com/voseldop/shards","title":"Shards","type":"watchface","uuid":"3ca13d01-7969-40d6-89d1-0151c9a6c339","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
