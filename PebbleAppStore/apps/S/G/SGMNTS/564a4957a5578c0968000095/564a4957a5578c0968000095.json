It's built up from outside to the inside, from bottom layer to top layer, telling the hours, ten-minute-increments and single minutes by segments that are placed at the well known analog watch number positions. The size of the segments varies every time the display refreshes, giving the watchface a different fractured look. The size does NOT matter here, just the amount of segments for the different parts of time. The angle of the final segment is extended to the 360° to fill the display before it gets empty again (going back to 0). The colors look different depending on the color of the Pebble Time round. Please check the example times and the header of this description.  \r\n\r\nDesign / Programming / Copyright © 2012, 2015 Sam Jerichow","developer_id":"54ed03c2d9c53b312f00010f","header_images":"","hearts":18,"id":"564a4957a5578c0968000095","latest_release":{"id":"565058efcd8d2f8165000043","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/o5np2sLsTESCoLF3eQaZ","published_date":"2015-11-21T11:43:52.997Z","release_notes":"Time for an update!
