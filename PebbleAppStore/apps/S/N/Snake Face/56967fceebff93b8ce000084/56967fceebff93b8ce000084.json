When he's got 60 points, he moves onto the next level - just like a real snake!  Of course, every time he eats food, he grows a bit - by the end of each hour he's massive!\r\n\r\nWhen your battery is low, he forces himself to eat batteries instead of food to subtly let you know what's up.  No Bluetooth connection?  No problem - Mr Snake will gobble down Bluetooth symbols so you're never knowingly disconnected!\r\n\r\nHe's the best friend you never knew you needed - and you can modify his colours without him even blinking.  How could he - he hasn't even got any eyes!","developer_id":"52f1776ce21be4b820000759","header_images":"","hearts":226,"id":"56967fceebff93b8ce000084","latest_release":{"id":"56b9ce7c518cf19587000003","js_md5":"ba7a8673b7181eb333cb52fa9f367fc1","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/koAsmlyQtmq7ZlsxpCbT","published_date":"2016-02-09T12:20:31.921Z","release_notes":"1.1 - Noticed that it doesn't always clear the hourly message when the snake starts moving again.
