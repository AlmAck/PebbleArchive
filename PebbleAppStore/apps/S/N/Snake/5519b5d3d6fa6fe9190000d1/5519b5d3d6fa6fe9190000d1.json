In that game, as you control a snake around the screen, pixel blocks appear which you try to intercept. As your snake eats the blocks the snake gets longer and longer.\r\n   \r\nHere it is not a game, but when the minutes change, the snake starts at the top left corner and grows.  As it does this, it creates a negative of the current time using the one continuous line - hours at the top, minutes at the bottom, with the colon between.\r\n\r\nAs the snake's body is a continuous line, that does not touch itself, it cannot create central circles in numbers, so the numbers that normally have these lose part of one of the sides.  Look at the example screenshots to see how these are displayed: 0, 6, 8 and 9. \r\n\r\nVersion 4.0 adds support for Pebble 2 and requires Pebble firmware v4.0.2 or later.\r\n\r\nScreenshots: \r\n(1)  Animation (slower than the watchface), shows the snake creating 17:21.\r\n(2) 12:59 \r\n(3) 08:46\r\n(4) 17:25 (24-hour)\r\n(5) 08:52 (with Quick View)\r\n\r\nScreenshots: \r\n(1)  Animation (slower than the watchface), shows the snake creating 17:21.\r\n(2) 12:59 \r\n(3) 08:46\r\n(4) 09:01 (with Quick View)\r\n\r\nDesign created by Peter Fletcher from UK and originally appeared on the Tokyoflash Design Studio.
