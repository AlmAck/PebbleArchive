When they point towards each other (like the third image) it is connected. If they point in different directions, then Bluetooth connection is lost. Underneath the bluetooth, the battery level can be found, each level for each tenth of the battery level, starting at 100% on top and finishing at 10% or 0% depending on the shape. The third image shows a battery level of 50%.\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy this watchface based on a design found in a hotel in London (Ham Yard Hotel). Please let me know if there is anyway I can improve it.","developer_id":"54f9046252794e6bd900009b","header_images":"","hearts":22,"id":"56067556e3fed40eba000042","latest_release":{"id":"56094b5d1e0926705d00005c","js_md5":"941695e4704cdc7677798dca269045fd","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/c1kuJ30Q9SQAhEyFPx3H","published_date":"2015-09-28T14:15:03.730Z","release_notes":"bug fixes","version":"1.2"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56067556e3fed40eba000042/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56067556e3fed40eba000042/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56067556e3fed40eba000042/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56067556e3fed40eba000042/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56067556e3fed40eba000042/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56067556e3fed40eba000042/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/56067556e3fed40eba000042"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/stmTYaRrQrnaPMIeO7t0/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/stmTYaRrQrnaPMIeO7t0/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-09-26T11:27:40.300Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/stmTYaRrQrnaPMIeO7t0/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/2NRzs5tRjuHL4lQNsGh4/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/7sicTCO9QxqwLdOrK4r2/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/wgbqhlMsTPu0ju5WnJuY/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/rU88KJJjQDiY5pvo480y/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"https://github.com/joravasal/SpocksWF","title":"Spocks","type":"watchface","uuid":"660f7a24-08fa-4f61-8551-40a2f632c041","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
