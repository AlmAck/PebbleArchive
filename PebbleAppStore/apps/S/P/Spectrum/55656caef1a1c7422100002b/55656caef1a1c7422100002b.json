It started as binary idea. 1 = white and 0 = black. Once I had the basic shades for the basic numbers I thought, it would be interesting to give all the other numbers parts of the color spectrum. The cool thing is, the color spectrum can be divided into 8 distinguishable colors indeed! I'm using four long bars to tell the time. This is inspired by emission spectra of elements that get passed by light. The width of the bars increases by the usage of that digit. \r\n\r\nSo basically, each number is a color. Sounds simple, but how do you learn which color belongs to which number? Make up a story. Red is love of two people. Orange three sounds like orange tree etc. The sillier the story, the easier to memorize. After a while you can read the watch faster while others just see wrist decoration.\r\n\r\nCheck out the color reference chart in the preview section and... good luck!\r\n\r\nDesign / Programming / Copyright Â© 2012, 2015 Sam Jerichow\r\n\r\nI thank Nev Rawlins for his support!","developer_id":"54ed03c2d9c53b312f00010f","header_images":"","hearts":8,"id":"55656caef1a1c7422100002b","latest_release":{"id":"55656cfbf1a1c76877000030","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/NeKXLpCERvSvnYEzuSnw","published_date":"2015-05-27T07:07:35.070Z","release_notes":"","version":"1.0"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55656caef1a1c7422100002b/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55656caef1a1c7422100002b/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55656caef1a1c7422100002b/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55656caef1a1c7422100002b/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55656caef1a1c7422100002b/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55656caef1a1c7422100002b/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/55656caef1a1c7422100002b"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/Ail7MnZRm28Zo8jd1HjU/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/Ail7MnZRm28Zo8jd1HjU/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-05-27T07:07:38.344Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/Ail7MnZRm28Zo8jd1HjU/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/nq5dWDsUSD26SDmaArbJ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/H4lvImhYSDSVV9hIsl19/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/SZT7OMORlCLKH8PhYslW/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/JQhs8RRRuSj9Qcy8vSeb/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"Spectrum","type":"watchface","uuid":"06319252-4781-4833-aa03-95d7fd4dde21","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
