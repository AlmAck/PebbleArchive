The app includes stopwatch functionality to keep track of the time of a sporting event, as well as score keeping functionality for two teams. \r\n\r\nUsers can keep track of scores for two teams by using either the Up button (Home Team) or Down button (Away Team). The app supports single clicks, double clicks, and long clicks to change the score. Clicks can be customized for most sports by changing the score increments to match any sport (for instance, 1, 2, and 3 points for basketball or 1, 3, and 6 points for football).\r\n\r\nThis the perfect app for score keepers, referees, or sport enthusiasts!\r\n\r\nTo-Do:\r\n- Make this page way better looking.\r\n\r\nNotes: \r\n- This is my first published app of any kind, so if you find any bugs or have any feature requests please let me know!\r\n- This app began life as a school project; I want to thank TJ Taylor and Javier Lores who I worked with on the project and who helped write that version of the app.","developer_id":"52f049ddbb34231cf300115a","header_images":[{"orig":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/8Mc7C6okS8u65mDFrvxg/convert?cache=true&fit=crop","720x320":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/8Mc7C6okS8u65mDFrvxg/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=720&h=320"}],"hearts":22,"icon_image":{"28x28":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/5WZ7OzZQySmqXaKDKi1w/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=28&h=28","48x48":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/5WZ7OzZQySmqXaKDKi1w/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=48&h=48"},"id":"5596fdf684bff56157000094","latest_release":{"id":"563fcf299793109fbd000086","js_md5":"49b8d65444381580063a5e8950d9a6fd","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/mztX8cZTTuqtZncsKk4G","published_date":"2015-11-08T22:40:05.882Z","release_notes":"SportsOfficial finally supports colors!
