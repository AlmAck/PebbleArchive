Using pebble.js and the splatoon.ink API, the app reports the current maps and the maps for the next 2 rotations, mirroring the information available at splatoon.nintendo.net.\r\n\r\nDISCLAIMER: Since this app pulls data from an external API, it will not function properly if it is disconnected from your phone or if your phone cannot connect to the internet.\r\n\r\nWith the v2.2 update, much of the app's backend has been restructured to handle the current structure of the Splatoon.ink API's response data, and the app's image handling has been updated to work under current firmware's new bitmap handling.\r\n\r\nCurrent features include:\r\n\r\n- Color distinction for Random and Ranked maps (Basalt only, Aplite support upcoming b/c WOO GRAY)\r\n- Shake to refresh maps (The app currently also refreshes its map data any time it's closed)\r\n- Autodetection of your local time zone and proper time adjustment\r\n- Error handling for Splatfests or splatoon.ink request failures\r\n- 100% more WOOMY!\r\n\r\nFor any problems or bugs with the app, please let me know! This is my first watchapp, so I appreciate the feedback. You can reach me through the email link below or you can message me directly on Reddit: /u/greater_nemo.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to support Splatime Monitor or future apps, feel free to donate at paypal.me/greaternemo . I do my coding in my free time, so any little bit is appreciated. :)","developer_id":"55f8a3921e01e9c144000015","header_images":"","hearts":37,"icon_image":{"28x28":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/2salE5ApRYqtM9LCiaHT/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=28&h=28","48x48":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/2salE5ApRYqtM9LCiaHT/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=48&h=48"},"id":"560aea092e1a4ac097000003","latest_release":{"id":"56b82cbe0d7f39fddd000054","js_md5":"0dd4336378b46f969d9f41ffc02258cf","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/QClUu43bSx6KGUdMcaAj","published_date":"2016-02-08T05:53:02.042Z","release_notes":"Updated codebase to handle current structure from the Splatoon.ink API response, including the new(ish) splatfest flag.\r\nAdded a ton of documentation, including examples of the current API structure that splatmonitor.js is written to process.\r\nAdded and updated debug cases to work with the new API structure.\r\nBeautified the entire codebase.\r\nRemoved a lot of comments and cruft, including deleting feature.js because idgaf.\r\nUpdated all the image handling to work under current firmware versions as bitmap resources.\r\nWOOMY.","version":"2.2"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/560aea092e1a4ac097000003/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/560aea092e1a4ac097000003/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/560aea092e1a4ac097000003/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/560aea092e1a4ac097000003/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/560aea092e1a4ac097000003/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/560aea092e1a4ac097000003/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/560aea092e1a4ac097000003"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/rYA3L8ImT4yvDyVnKiv0/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/rYA3L8ImT4yvDyVnKiv0/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-09-29T23:40:19.361Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/ahcj4l42RNO5nwzXYdV1/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/1xXJiwFRqyi9aXifvDYQ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/Zc1YWIASmurmR6SgPEyt/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/f0sK9TQsTLGMcGkN2ROo/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/Sp2A456QSrSGdSFEGXga/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"https://github.com/greaternemo/splatime-monitor","title":"Splatime Monitor","type":"watchapp","uuid":"0b4c1dc4-a1d3-446a-b239-378c43089c01","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
