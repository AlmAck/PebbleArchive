The information on display is time, date, battery level, but most important bluetooth lost connection indicator. This last feature is added to prevent losing the phone. When the bluetooth connection is lost, the watch will vibrate and an invalid bluetooth symbol will show. When connection is restored, the watch will vibrate again, and the invalid bluetooth symbol will be removed from the screen. Every time the minute changes, the spider will rotate three times. Every time the accelerometer is used to light up the screen, the animation will play again. When returning to the watch face after using the buttons, the animation will play as well.","developer_id":"560d1bb0cda63289ce000066","header_images":"","hearts":3,"id":"5766c5123feaee1b80000221","latest_release":{"id":"57dd57932d0cc8dcb4000270","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/d46ziY1QpaAwK0oMKmlf","published_date":"2016-09-17T14:48:00.614Z","release_notes":"","version":"2.0"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5766c5123feaee1b80000221/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5766c5123feaee1b80000221/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5766c5123feaee1b80000221/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5766c5123feaee1b80000221/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5766c5123feaee1b80000221/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5766c5123feaee1b80000221/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/5766c5123feaee1b80000221"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/xU4LDh1eTOOlUUvtCxcz/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/xU4LDh1eTOOlUUvtCxcz/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2016-09-17T14:48:04.038Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/xU4LDh1eTOOlUUvtCxcz/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"Spider Watchface","type":"watchface","uuid":"b46a3780-cfb6-4fd9-a44e-90bd94f6d34c","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
