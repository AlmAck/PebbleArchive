A species is automatically killed when its diversity is too high or too low. This also can be done by tapping on your watch (z axis). You can add new cells by 'punching' ;)  (y axis). The diversity (0 - 25%) is displayed on the right. \r\n\r\nThe rule set string is defined as : \r\n[1-2] size of neighborhood function [B] neighbors needed for birth [S] neighbors needed for survival [G] current generation\r\n\r\nPredefined rule sets are:\r\n\"1B3S23\", // Game of Life\r\n\"1B36S23\", // HighLife\r\n\"1B35678S5678\", //\tDiamoeba\r\n\"1B2S\", // Seeds\r\n\"1B36S125\", // 2x2\r\n\"1B368S245\", // Morley\r\n\"2B4S4\",  // Long term evolution\r\n\r\nFor further explanation of the subject i would recommend this read:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-like_cellular_automaton and the BBC documentary The Secret Life of Chaos (2010)\r\n\r\nThis hobby project is wip. I would like to add a config option in the future.\r\n\r\nHave fun!","developer_id":"5463afb001d09d6822000078","header_images":"","hearts":33,"id":"554cd821b62c117f6f00003f","latest_release":{"id":"554cd8b539191bf755000044","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/5gw6CHBQu6aMGfidzlkd","published_date":"2015-05-08T17:48:29.556Z","release_notes":"This first public release of Species Alpha is a  multi-platform build for Pebble and Pebble Time.","version":"2.0"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/554cd821b62c117f6f00003f/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/554cd821b62c117f6f00003f/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/554cd821b62c117f6f00003f/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/554cd821b62c117f6f00003f/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/554cd821b62c117f6f00003f/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/554cd821b62c117f6f00003f/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/554cd821b62c117f6f00003f"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/aE09Tfn2QTuFe1tIRhgh/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/aE09Tfn2QTuFe1tIRhgh/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-05-08T17:51:21.172Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/aE09Tfn2QTuFe1tIRhgh/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/H39oP7y3Rt2PcKKW3UiR/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"Species Alpha","type":"watchface","uuid":"48640721-36da-458a-afd5-22bd4afda0de","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
