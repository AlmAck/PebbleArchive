You read it like an analog watch, except the hours are told precisely, not gradually. You will encounter differently hatched/shaded areas that tell the time. These areas start at the 12h position and grow clockwise. A 100% dense area is hours and minutes overlapping. Hours are 75% shaded. Minutes are 25% shaded. (75%+25%=100%) So you never see those two shades at the same time. It's either 100% and 75% or 100% and 25%, because it's either the hours or the minutes that leave the overlap. So remember, the 100% area is always the opposite of what left the overlap. This sounds more complicated than it is. 0% is just the background. For watches with black bezels, the background is also black while the drawing colour is white. For watches whith white bezels, the colors are swapped. \r\n\r\nDesign / Programming / Copyright Â© 2013, 2015 Sam Jerichow","developer_id":"54ed03c2d9c53b312f00010f","header_images":"","hearts":36,"id":"56523bc2772bc43ff000001b","latest_release":{"id":"56850a6fb356930dd40000a6","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/UIBfoCgsROnT0RlaI1ew","published_date":"2015-12-31T13:49:19.174Z","release_notes":"Sector is now available for the original Pebble and the Steel.
