The app lists and saves up to 50 timestamps with duration of each session (the time between two timestamps). The time duration since the latest timestamp is shown at the top and is updated every second.\r\n\r\nSimply press the select button to create a new timestamp. A long press will clear the list and start with a new timestamp.\r\n\r\nIt is a standalone watchapp and doesn't need a smartphone connection.\r\n\r\nIf you like Session Timer, please give it a heart!\r\n\r\nAdditional features are not planned â€“ if you would like to add some, just grab the sourcecode from GitHub and feel free to reuse it.
