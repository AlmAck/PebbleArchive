Means in case InfoWatch or SlideDeck has to restart the look and feel of the app didn't get lost.\r\nSelected data gathered from the internet is cached. Means in case InfoWatch or SlideDeck has to restart weather information, stock remains available (for a reload period) and mustn't be reloaded (from the internet). Let's name it a fast load operation. ;)\r\nOptimizations:\r\n\r\nFinalization and use of a new own pebble (GUI) lib was the main topic of this release. Nearly all functionality is now provided by a lib. Two positive consequences: Stability, memory reduction and the opportunity for rapid new app development. ;)\r\n\r\nKnown problem:\r\n\r\nSome special chars are not shown in the news InfoPanel. For example the words with accent and the spanish letter \"ñ\", doesn't show correctly. I use the pebble system font \"FONT_KEY_GOTHIC_14\" to show news texts in the normal InfoPanel. Due to this you have to use pebblebits to generate a system font set also covering your local chars.\r\nSometimes the settings dialog will not open and instead an endless animated gif cycle is shown. This is a pebble app \"bug\"/ problem. A simple solution is to retry after you opened another setting dialog. Sorry I've no influence and can't fix anything.

Furthermore I'm searching for translations for \"Max:\" and \"Min:\".\r\n\r\nOptimizations:\r\n\r\n* Fully reimplemented the load data algorithm and redesigned some pebble to phone exchange data structures.\r\n* Outsourced further string tokens into resource files - due to this no further memory is necessary in case new translations were added. In case your translation is still missing/ or incorrect, provide the translation to me - (for a small donation) I will add/ correct it.\r\n* Again further memory improvements to get more free space for new functionality - we remain below the 24kb barrier. ;)\r\n* A few layout improvements.\r\n\r\nBugfixes:\r\n\r\n* Hopefully I fixed now the \"Fix weather forecast got lost\" bug.\r\n* Now further special chars will be handled which are not part of the iPhone charset.\r\n* A lot of small fixes not worth to get mentioned in detail.

Due to this on a pebblebits basis e.g. greece fonts will be available for feed texts.\r\n* Bigger fonts and display for News, Stocks etc. that will help older people or people with poor eyesight to read the content.\r\n* Extended news texts.\r\n* Optimized accelerator control. Now demanded information is available without e.g. pressing two buttons – you only have to rotate your wrist.\r\n* Optimized error reporting that shows in an understandable manner the state of the spluttering pebble app. ;)\r\n\r\nThe newly born SlideDesk V1.0 will be a parallel product to the InfoWatch V3.0. For example it not offers \r\n\r\n* … fixed info panels.\r\n* … according to the memory bounds the third feed got lost.\r\n\r\nEven through the remaining functionality is quite the same both products will evolve in different directions: Whereas the InfoWatch is designed to provide short and more information the SlideDeck was developed to provide long, detailed but less information.
