If raw enabled on pebble endpoint, show calculated raw on face.\r\n3. If raw enabled on pebble endpoint, show noise levels on face. Noise levels displayed - Cln Clean, Lgt Light, Med Medium, Hvy Heavy.\r\n4. If raw enabled on pebble endpoint, in special values (e.g. ???) the last three calculated values will be displayed in the BG field if they exist.\r\n5. If raw enabled on pebble endpoint, watch can vibrate on last calculated raw in special values (e.g. ???). User can set the setting in the configuration file to \"Yes\" or \"No\".\r\n6. User can put \"IOB\" in T1DName in config, and if IOB is enabled on website the IOB value will show up instead of T1DName.\r\n7. Move rig / uploader battery percentage to top half and label as \"Rig\".\r\n8. Show watch battery percentage on face, and switch percentage to CHARGING when plugged in. Label as \"Wch\".\r\n9. Extend RESTRT timeout so that it appears after NO BLUETOOTH timeout, and really only appears when needed.\r\n10. Extend DATA timeout so that it appears after CHECK PHONE timeout, and really only appears when needed.\r\n11. Change RESTRT WCH/PHN message to âˆšAPP/RESTRT, to instruct apple users to open their app, and instruct everyone to restart their watch and phone if necessary.\r\n12. Change DATA OFFLINE message to ATTN: NO DATA to warn users that there is a problem getting data but imply we are still trying to get data and will clear the message when we can.\r\n13. Change CHECK CGM message to CHECK RIG to clarify to the user that they need to check the entire rig, not just the CGM.\r\n14. Ability to set custom and multiple animation messages at different BG levels in the code."},{"version":"6.4","published_date":"2015-01-12T17:35:26.934Z","release_notes":"1.
