There are the expected four numbers but they are black on black background. To make them visible, each of them has two sides lit up by an imaginative lightsource in the very center of the watchface. Normally one expects all four numbers to be lit the same way - and that would make them easier to read - but placing the light source in the middle, creates a nice little artwork that at certain times resembles a cross. That's why I gave it the name Sanctus. \r\n\r\nDesign / Programming / Copyright Â© 2015 Sam Jerichow","developer_id":"54ed03c2d9c53b312f00010f","header_images":"","hearts":64,"id":"55d6299357ce9396b8000030","latest_release":{"id":"55d774ce276b2081e7000020","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/iBqmmBZvTqi57N5z8xYg","published_date":"2015-08-21T19:23:17.943Z","release_notes":"","version":"1.0"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55d6299357ce9396b8000030/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55d6299357ce9396b8000030/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55d6299357ce9396b8000030/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55d6299357ce9396b8000030/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55d6299357ce9396b8000030/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55d6299357ce9396b8000030/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/55d6299357ce9396b8000030"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/u1XWoUeXRtGTDlElAcr8/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/u1XWoUeXRtGTDlElAcr8/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-08-21T19:25:42.182Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/u1XWoUeXRtGTDlElAcr8/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/59pxRgJGQrq7Ql9G5Rzv/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/viNjaxmsTI6B3cgixCYR/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/E2VPjyRT1WfAm4U5sFqF/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"Sanctus","type":"watchface","uuid":"7e8468f0-ded3-4c3a-b71a-7236d96d1993","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
