SkyLight was inspired by my working indoors with no windows and wanting to \"see what the sky is doing\". I also wanted a watchface that displayed varied at-a-glace data without additional apps, but only when I activated it (to save power).\r\n \r\n= Instructions =\r\n\r\n- Shake your wrist to turn on the backlight as normal.\r\n    * The compass and seconds indicator will activate while the backlight is active \r\n- If you shake again while the light is still on, it will stay on until you shake again.\r\n    * The compass indicates backlight lock by turning from blue to red.\r\n \r\n= Features =\r\n\r\nTetherless:\r\n- iso8601 time\r\n- Sun/Moon positions (counter-clockwise, i.e. east->west) \r\n- Compass and seconds disabled until activated to save battery\r\n- Pebble battery % \r\n- Day of the week\r\n- Sky changes color based on time of day\r\n\r\nTethered: \r\n- None yet\r\n\r\n= Planned features =\r\n\r\nTetherless: \r\n- Sun/moon indicators while below the horizon. Was thinking sunflower/mouse (mouse->cheese->moon), let me know what you think\r\n- Moon will show moon phase\r\n\r\nTethered: \r\n- Weather effects in the sky \r\n- Current temp \r\n- Altitude \r\n- Barometric pressure over time \r\n- Current speed (when activated) \r\n- Phone battery %\r\n\r\n= Current known issues = \r\n\r\n- sun/moon calc for Arizona, local position soon\r\n\r\n= Please send feedback! = \r\n\r\n- Font's not finalized, let me know what would work better\r\n- I'm not married to these colors. Let me know if you like, or want to change, the readability\r\n- Send me wanted features :)","developer_id":"554bdc00578fc6d9210000a9","header_images":"","hearts":17,"id":"55712460ddc5cc49d6000073","latest_release":{"id":"55938612043f1b9ceb00001b","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/cM2RfMkRMOURWKQa9YB7","published_date":"2015-07-01T06:20:33.764Z","release_notes":"- Kicked it so hard, it now sees the curvature of the earth","version":"4.2"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55712460ddc5cc49d6000073/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55712460ddc5cc49d6000073/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55712460ddc5cc49d6000073/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55712460ddc5cc49d6000073/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55712460ddc5cc49d6000073/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55712460ddc5cc49d6000073/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/55712460ddc5cc49d6000073"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/mdIhIkZOQL2T03exy60L/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/mdIhIkZOQL2T03exy60L/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-06-29T00:28:07.088Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/mdIhIkZOQL2T03exy60L/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/c1iZNudMRmWDVySozCfV/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/QKDpzOMMQRqQfd9MI5Ra/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/6SC1UZ0ARcOV6jon6rTC/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/mv6CbYvKQYuKwN58fiDD/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"SkyLight","type":"watchface","uuid":"586b0fb2-9426-40ae-9254-f4fa9bc59836","website":"http://www.AlexanderESmith.com/-/pebble"}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
