They create a single,  interesting looking shape that has to be read top to bottom. \r\n\r\nIn Super the numbers have different colours and the overlapping parallelogram shows the combination colour - a little design tweak for colour fans. \r\n\r\nIn Spirit the differently coloured numbers moved closer and overlap more. So there are more combination colour areas that leave a maybe hard to read but not unreadyble display. May the spirits help you reading that little piece of art.\r\n\r\nDesign : Sam Jerichow Programming : Sam Jerichow\r\nCopyright Â© 2015 Sam Jerichow","developer_id":"54ed03c2d9c53b312f00010f","header_images":"","hearts":20,"id":"557c60c34923dd7958000058","latest_release":{"id":"557c6113db598b8f17000047","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/oyiFHrsKQrCN7LKLfufm","published_date":"2015-07-18T08:50:51.966Z","release_notes":"","version":"1.0"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/557c60c34923dd7958000058/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/557c60c34923dd7958000058/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/557c60c34923dd7958000058/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/557c60c34923dd7958000058/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/557c60c34923dd7958000058/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/557c60c34923dd7958000058/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/557c60c34923dd7958000058"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/h9lHRpjThqwkGclprkS1/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/h9lHRpjThqwkGclprkS1/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-07-18T08:53:15.666Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/h9lHRpjThqwkGclprkS1/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/S5H7qITlfrPTxyvJJXAH/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/rjXtBTBmonAJ9d9qf2Q6/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/dVjwR938SeeeQIhjAcZR/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"Skew Spirit CMY","type":"watchface","uuid":"56738c18-0de9-461a-832c-2af579b3ee3a","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
