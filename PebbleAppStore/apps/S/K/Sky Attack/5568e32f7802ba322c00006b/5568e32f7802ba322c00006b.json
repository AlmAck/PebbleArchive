I've drawn all the graphics pixel by pixel and tried to make the gameplay as authentic as possible.\r\n\r\nWhat's working:\r\nPlayer moves & shoots\r\nEnemies move & shoot\r\nCollision detection\r\nLevel/Enemy speed up every 100 points (20 enemies)\r\nEnemies explode\r\n\r\nStill to do:\r\nMenus / Game over (restart)\r\nMake middle enemies move sideways\r\nEnemy double shots\r\nBonus level (4 fast moving enemies worth 50 points after each level)\r\nExtra life every 1000 points\r\nPossible future additions:\r\nLandscape mode\r\nAutofire (cos everyone that played the original always held fire down)\r\nAccuracy (display shot accuracy at game over when not using autofire)","developer_id":"549f60677c5f0ee803000014","header_images":[{"orig":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/mZOkqt9XQCOFgKHeZY0L/convert?cache=true&fit=crop","720x320":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/mZOkqt9XQCOFgKHeZY0L/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=720&h=320"}],"hearts":148,"icon_image":{"28x28":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/tUsmrePTW27okLGLrXSA/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=28&h=28","48x48":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/tUsmrePTW27okLGLrXSA/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=48&h=48"},"id":"5568e32f7802ba322c00006b","latest_release":{"id":"563be9e8d886bbd764000004","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/QIxukMGJSICqN87BF3yt","published_date":"2015-11-05T23:45:25.320Z","release_notes":"Updated for Pebble Time Round (Chalk)","version":"1.1"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5568e32f7802ba322c00006b/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5568e32f7802ba322c00006b/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5568e32f7802ba322c00006b/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5568e32f7802ba322c00006b/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5568e32f7802ba322c00006b/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5568e32f7802ba322c00006b/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/5568e32f7802ba322c00006b"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/lInA2efCTRuYKdRQKfHD/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/lInA2efCTRuYKdRQKfHD/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-05-29T22:55:24.355Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/XtcECjqDSSSSHqYXOhI7/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"Sky Attack","type":"watchapp","uuid":"1ff40b94-b861-4c68-9e59-c3edc95f4d09","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
