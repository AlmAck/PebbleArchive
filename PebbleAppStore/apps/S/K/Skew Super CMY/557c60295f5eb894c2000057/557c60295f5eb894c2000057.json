They create a single,  interesting looking shape that has to be read top to bottom. \r\n\r\nIn Super the numbers have different colours and the overlapping parallelogram shows the combination colour - a little design tweak for colour fans. \r\n\r\nIn Spirit the differently coloured numbers moved closer and overlap more. So there are more combination colour areas that leave a maybe hard to read but not unreadyble display. May the spirits help you reading that little piece of art.\r\n\r\nDesign : Sam Jerichow Programming : Sam Jerichow\r\nCopyright Â© 2015 Sam Jerichow","developer_id":"54ed03c2d9c53b312f00010f","header_images":"","hearts":74,"id":"557c60295f5eb894c2000057","latest_release":{"id":"557c60b4db598b620e000057","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/C8dDwtXSlqeXV82GgVzg","published_date":"2015-07-18T08:50:58.564Z","release_notes":"","version":"1.0"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/557c60295f5eb894c2000057/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/557c60295f5eb894c2000057/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/557c60295f5eb894c2000057/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/557c60295f5eb894c2000057/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/557c60295f5eb894c2000057/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/557c60295f5eb894c2000057/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/557c60295f5eb894c2000057"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/gurNIuVaQ561dkwVwxMX/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/gurNIuVaQ561dkwVwxMX/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-07-18T08:53:24.963Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/gurNIuVaQ561dkwVwxMX/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/5ga3TiPUTA2XxH0LF1QI/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/OtyH8j4SHygAErGSnoAR/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/sJbOwcKEQnuivEshRSIb/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"Skew Super CMY","type":"watchface","uuid":"0b2f5990-8f70-4a7b-91bc-e4e1bd9a5594","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
