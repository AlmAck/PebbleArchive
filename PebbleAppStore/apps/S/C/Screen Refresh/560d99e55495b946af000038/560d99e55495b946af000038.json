You probably have no use for it.  It does not tell the time in any way.  It can, however, be used to get rid of a residual image or \"ghosting\" left as a result of a watch freeze.  It does this by rapidly cycling through all of the colors on the watch face (or just black and white on the original pebble).  As it cycles, the residual image should fade.  \r\n\r\nIt will likely DRAIN YOUR BATTERY quickly and may DAMAGE YOUR SCREEN if you use it for an extended period of time.  \r\n\r\nI TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY DAMAGE DONE TO YOUR WATCH.","developer_id":"550e2a0b978aa962c30000ab","header_images":"","hearts":11,"id":"560d99e55495b946af000038","latest_release":{"id":"56496a91a5578c096800003f","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/GtWqu4huRY2Zac9qQGhw","published_date":"2015-11-16T05:33:20.949Z","release_notes":"Added support for Pebble Round","version":"1.2"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/560d99e55495b946af000038/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/560d99e55495b946af000038/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/560d99e55495b946af000038/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/560d99e55495b946af000038/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/560d99e55495b946af000038/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/560d99e55495b946af000038/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/560d99e55495b946af000038"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/xsMijjAvTzuNxt36DGtD/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/xsMijjAvTzuNxt36DGtD/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-10-02T01:28:54.145Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/xsMijjAvTzuNxt36DGtD/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"Screen Refresh","type":"watchface","uuid":"4457bf57-2168-4a82-9327-e153c58378e6","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
