The ability to configure your own schedule will be added soon! \r\n\r\nNOTE: Thanks to everyone who has tried and liked my app.  I've been super busy with schoolwork, but I will fix the issues preventing the configuration page from working ASAP.","developer_id":"52cb1fe8e2dd020cb1000044","header_images":"","hearts":56,"id":"540a3b12c7980ced84000021","latest_release":{"id":"540a3c22c7980c8937000012","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/O2UBxggCTnOW8kfMmSMm","published_date":"2014-09-05T22:42:12.428Z","release_notes":"v1.0\r\n\r\nDisplays time remaining in, or time until each class period.\r\nConfiguration coming soon!","version":"1.0"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/540a3b12c7980ced84000021/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/540a3b12c7980ced84000021/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/540a3b12c7980ced84000021/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/540a3b12c7980ced84000021/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/540a3b12c7980ced84000021/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/540a3b12c7980ced84000021/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/540a3b12c7980ced84000021"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/ng3Ot5T7TpKsBv5qHfkA/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/ng3Ot5T7TpKsBv5qHfkA/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2014-09-05T22:42:37.567Z","screenshot_hardware":"aplite","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/ng3Ot5T7TpKsBv5qHfkA/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"https://github.com/rhuffy/School-Schedule/","title":"School Schedule","type":"watchface","uuid":"625048c4-3ecc-4bfe-9bed-e8d3c9a55a94","website":"http://forum.xda-developers.com/pebble/pebble-development/competition-school-schedule-how-time-t2852455"}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
