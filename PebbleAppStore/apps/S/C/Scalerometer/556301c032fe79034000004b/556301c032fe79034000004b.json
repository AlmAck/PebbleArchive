A scale on your wrist!\r\n\r\nHow it works:\r\nThe app works by detecting how fast you can oscillate a certain object. The heavier an object is, the slower you will be able to swing it up and down which can be detected using the accelerometer.\r\nThe accuracy greatly depends on your ability to use a constant effort when calibrating and weighing objects. Make sure you use the same force for all weights instead of trying to oscillate even heavy weights as fast as possible.\r\n\r\nTo extend the range that can be weighed, it is usually best to start with your empty hand and swing as fast as you can, then keep the same force for higher weights. You need to calibrate with at least 3 different known weights!","developer_id":"52dbd1049ffd8704a300004e","header_images":[{"orig":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/SCDeDMJlQOSq9RifpKo8/convert?cache=true&fit=crop","720x320":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/SCDeDMJlQOSq9RifpKo8/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=720&h=320"}],"hearts":26,"icon_image":{"28x28":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/OQgBDKiQRGbAxl5OAiqQ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=28&h=28","48x48":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/OQgBDKiQRGbAxl5OAiqQ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=48&h=48"},"id":"556301c032fe79034000004b","latest_release":{"id":"5770caf16c2104ad1700012a","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/90qKegjRT6M2ldCoQ8Mj","published_date":"2016-06-27T06:43:09.277Z","release_notes":"Reduced memory usage to prevent crashes","version":"1.2"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/556301c032fe79034000004b/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/556301c032fe79034000004b/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/556301c032fe79034000004b/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/556301c032fe79034000004b/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/556301c032fe79034000004b/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/556301c032fe79034000004b/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/556301c032fe79034000004b"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/2dRG4ebHT9C2wAVJ45f3/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/2dRG4ebHT9C2wAVJ45f3/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-05-25T14:11:00.799Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/vOjArq4ETgSjuDyJYBCJ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/p4Td0U4ATh6NheUIgFOd/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/Fg7FmKVRRJWGdih9iarv/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"https://github.com/technicallyfeasible/PebbleScale","title":"Scalerometer","type":"watchapp","uuid":"2dc40554-c358-4514-a53f-81c9b1665a33","website":"http://www.technicallyfeasible.com"}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
