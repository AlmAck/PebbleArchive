It shows time and the current date (weekday / day), on wrist shake health data (sleep in the morning, steps after 2000 are reached) is shown for 3 seconds.\r\n \r\na8Bit features Clay offline configuration for:\r\n- Color theme: CGA (Palette1), Monochrome (BW), Green, Amber, Commodore (white on blue) and Gameboy (looks more like the real thing on the watch)\r\n- Show health as default (date on wrist shake)\r\n\r\nCREDITS: This app uses the free \"PressStart2P\" font (licensed under SIL Open Fonts license http://scripts.sil.org/OFL) and the Silkscreen font (under 'Kottke Silkscreen license' http://bit.ly/2bl9SQf). Special thanks to Reno, whose Sayga watchface (http://bit.ly/2aOD16z) was an inspiration, although this is a completely independent implementation.\r\n \r\nDISCLAIMER: I created this for my personal use on a Pebble Time, and I'm sharing it in the hope that it might be useful for you, too. Use at your own risk, and if you have any bug reports or suggestions let me know, I'll see what I can do.","developer_id":"56c56e989a0e12214c00000c","header_images":"","hearts":34,"id":"57a85f001482cdecc700063d","latest_release":{"id":"57c7fc97f69d1d852f000704","js_md5":"84261f661c2f43600054ff575b8c0f8c","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/H6rb9S4VSk2ll1iysVzd","published_date":"2016-09-01T10:17:25.305Z","release_notes":"Pebble2 / Diorite support","version":"1.2"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57a85f001482cdecc700063d/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57a85f001482cdecc700063d/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57a85f001482cdecc700063d/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57a85f001482cdecc700063d/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57a85f001482cdecc700063d/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57a85f001482cdecc700063d/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/57a85f001482cdecc700063d"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/rErTpYXXQzKuwloGa7EP/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/rErTpYXXQzKuwloGa7EP/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2016-08-11T14:03:43.806Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/rErTpYXXQzKuwloGa7EP/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/ZMvkmEJsRw67MX2rTGAC/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/B4z0SLT1CSDYfnRMIKgL/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/BuioVXg1TWagjIYyQDsr/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/TpjVyW3S86rJwJL2ZSQQ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"https://github.com/axel668/a8bit","title":"a8bit","type":"watchface","uuid":"288a5093-126a-4546-b264-970d3aedd317","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
