In simple words - you don't have to worry about your battery.\r\n\r\n Completely configurable. You can configure:\r\n - Different maze backgrounds\r\n - shake-to-date on/off, shake-to-seconds on/off (for even more battery saving, if you don't need seconds and/or date)\r\n - time how long date/seconds will show\r\n - time and background color (color pebbles only)\r\n - bluetooth connection vibration alarm\r\n - bluetooth status icon (only when disconnected)\r\n - battery icon (off, on 10%, on 10% and 20% with different icons)\r\n - date format\r\n - Croatian localisaton (this one is for myself)\r\n \r\n support for oldschool B/W Pebble and Pebble Time (Square).\r\n No Pebble Round support yet.\r\n As I only have original B/W Pebble, I only tested color features in emulator, so I apologize for any bugs that I missed. I hope color features look nice.","developer_id":"56e335002526c72e66000023","header_images":"","hearts":74,"id":"573d93ea5253b12407000009","latest_release":{"id":"573d9c135253b1462f00000b","js_md5":"15d67e1dc8b14ffee0e5c7814be527c9","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/d3SykZiqSFahCHSplUZA","published_date":"2016-05-19T11:01:54.466Z","release_notes":"-Initial release","version":"1.0"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/573d93ea5253b12407000009/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/573d93ea5253b12407000009/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/573d93ea5253b12407000009/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/573d93ea5253b12407000009/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/573d93ea5253b12407000009/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/573d93ea5253b12407000009/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/573d93ea5253b12407000009"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/aC2hNhTM0IU1VIUaOoAF/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/aC2hNhTM0IU1VIUaOoAF/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2016-05-19T11:05:12.924Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/aC2hNhTM0IU1VIUaOoAF/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/EGIUup2XQxSBAnMLxjtw/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/0wkQo7E5TPeEt3RAn2Ig/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/mdgMRC0sTgWJHGZeLon3/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/2C7yGGxWSLmsM8zwGAlT/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"https://github.com/gogothegogo/Maze_Pebble","title":"A Maze","type":"watchface","uuid":"229f5b6f-d844-4bd3-8f67-c5766da0ad75","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
