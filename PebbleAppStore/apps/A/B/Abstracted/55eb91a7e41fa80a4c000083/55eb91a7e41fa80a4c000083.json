They act as tally marks (4 bars = 4 hours past 12, 5 bars = 5 hours past 12). Hours will count, starting from the top of the screen, up to 11, and at 12 will reset to 0 (0 hours past 12).\r\n\r\nMinutes are the thin diagonal stripes on the left side. They too act as tally marks, counting up to 59 and at 60/0 will reset to 0. They will fill up from the bottom of the screen to the black triangle in the corner.\r\n\r\nPM is represented by the large grey shade on the bottom right of the screen. If it is there, it is PM, if it is not, it is AM.\r\n\r\nNote: Abstracted is in 12hr format only.","developer_id":"53220c40a3f12b6331000032","header_images":"","hearts":17,"id":"55eb91a7e41fa80a4c000083","latest_release":{"id":"55eb92a3cd182cb66a000075","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/5Jja2MgdQuCzvfsxcayT","published_date":"2015-09-06T01:12:34.932Z","release_notes":"v1.1 Compatible with newer SDK\r\nv1.0 Release","version":"1.1"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55eb91a7e41fa80a4c000083/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55eb91a7e41fa80a4c000083/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55eb91a7e41fa80a4c000083/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55eb91a7e41fa80a4c000083/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55eb91a7e41fa80a4c000083/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55eb91a7e41fa80a4c000083/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/55eb91a7e41fa80a4c000083"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/Gw3AZtFTuuS3D4SCXT7l/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/Gw3AZtFTuuS3D4SCXT7l/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-09-06T01:13:23.201Z","screenshot_hardware":"aplite","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/Gw3AZtFTuuS3D4SCXT7l/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/X1dwQdjRr2R2yofbeX8w/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"https://github.com/profbetis/Abstracted","title":"Abstracted","type":"watchface","uuid":"0235b1e6-022e-42c4-be0c-2ea479b2a599","website":"http://bluevisual.tv"}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
