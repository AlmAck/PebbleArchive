It also supports toggling between who is pregnant (i.e. you or your partner).\r\n\r\nThis initial version only provides pregnancy tracking, but the plan is to expand it to include post-birth feeding and sleep tracking, plus other useful things to do with babies and pregnancy. Pre-birth pregnancy planning is also on the list.\r\n\r\nIf you have any ideas for features that would be useful, please reach out and let me know!\r\n\r\nI am making this for my wife who is currently pregnant, and I hope you find it as useful as we do! :-)\r\n","developer_id":"55449d09e628714030000037","header_images":[{"orig":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/TS2VcrAZSFaI8iydakXl/convert?cache=true&fit=crop","720x320":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/TS2VcrAZSFaI8iydakXl/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=720&h=320"}],"hearts":31,"icon_image":{"28x28":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/tw3w9EI7RUSisVmXEf4w/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=28&h=28","48x48":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/tw3w9EI7RUSisVmXEf4w/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=48&h=48"},"id":"568c45c586c86bd7fc00000b","latest_release":{"id":"5811edf7bd12f9525b000081","js_md5":"2856b76f7580848633332b6954e8c435","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/69K1U2TfQxOtq6TVWi8E","published_date":"2016-10-27T12:07:31.031Z","release_notes":"Emery support","version":"1.4"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/568c45c586c86bd7fc00000b/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/568c45c586c86bd7fc00000b/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/568c45c586c86bd7fc00000b/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/568c45c586c86bd7fc00000b/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/568c45c586c86bd7fc00000b/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/568c45c586c86bd7fc00000b/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/568c45c586c86bd7fc00000b"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/wbsYnyCTgGUCHagF1iWw/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/wbsYnyCTgGUCHagF1iWw/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2016-01-05T22:47:02.717Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/hvacnSSqRZKtiraswJIA/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/P2kaMmzrTiCf5YtQzdap/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/LF38SKqVRHBGCIc0mj6s/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"Aevitaz - Pregnancy Tracker","type":"watchapp","uuid":"65ffa27e-8a9c-4282-b02b-7c6190b87df9","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
