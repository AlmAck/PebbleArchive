Try out the demo mode and learn the secret.  Give it a heart if you have a heart, because it's made with love!\r\n\r\nHours count to 12 around the outside with the large squares.  Minutes count to 60 with small squares following a path around the interior.  Zero minutes is at 12:00, fifteen minutes at 3:00, thirty minutes at 6:00 and 45 minutes at 9:00.  It looks binary but it's really analog with the accuracy of digital.\r\n\r\nWhile learning the watchface, turn on the second hand and watch as the dot follows the same path as the minutes.","developer_id":"568cb96f7c21b31f29000043","header_images":"","hearts":20,"id":"56fa96cf3c131b30f100004b","latest_release":{"id":"5703dcb43bc6cdcade000032","js_md5":"1372e16a38cca8613e2408c28cb4f1f4","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/YSslb4tTQ6qRcAYP31ko","published_date":"2016-04-05T15:45:43.129Z","release_notes":"Improve startup behaviour.","version":"1.2"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56fa96cf3c131b30f100004b/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56fa96cf3c131b30f100004b/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56fa96cf3c131b30f100004b/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56fa96cf3c131b30f100004b/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56fa96cf3c131b30f100004b/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56fa96cf3c131b30f100004b/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/56fa96cf3c131b30f100004b"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/ajdAaHRSDWOOy5dLBQxa/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/ajdAaHRSDWOOy5dLBQxa/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2016-04-05T02:26:29.571Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/ajdAaHRSDWOOy5dLBQxa/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/5KQk0KKBQraQC7fwFlyr/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/aY7p5nFMQaGPPqgBHXGx/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/DiK5JJmhSQCT4qqIFOUX/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"Alien Binary Analog","type":"watchface","uuid":"0a2af29a-2bec-4655-88d0-7aa81e99d593","website":"http://www.robertames.com/"}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
