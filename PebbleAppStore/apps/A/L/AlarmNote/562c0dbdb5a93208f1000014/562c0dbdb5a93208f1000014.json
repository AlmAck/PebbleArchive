Added versions for newest Pebble watches.\r\n"},{"version":"1.9","published_date":"2016-10-24T00:44:22.180Z","release_notes":"Fixed a bug which kept the app from correctly reloading information when it restarts.  This prevented alarms from happening the next day, after working the first time.\r\n"},{"version":"1.8","published_date":"2016-10-17T19:00:46.049Z","release_notes":"Updated to use the \"Clay\" configuration package, which means it no longer requires an Internet connection in order to configure alarms.\r\n"},{"version":"1.7","published_date":"2016-06-07T15:13:49.076Z","release_notes":"This  set of changes allows the program to set alarms which only work\r\non specific days of the week.  By default, they all happen on all days,\r\nuntil you turn some days off.  This also adds the menu item to allow\r\nthe user to re-do the last alarm.  You can then snooze it.  (Useful if\r\nyou accidentally ack'ed an alarm which you didn't mean to.)  It also\r\nchanges the default snooze time from 10 to 20 minutes."},{"version":"1.6","published_date":"2016-02-07T19:04:15.165Z","release_notes":"Fixed various bugs, removed scheduling alarms via older API and relying totally on the new API now, which simplified the code.  Fixed problem where an alarm could not be scheduled if it happened to be at the same time as a different alarm, even if that different alarm was in a different program.  (It will not move an alarm forward by a minute or more, if needed, in order to get it scheduled."},{"version":"1.4","published_date":"2015-12-24T19:16:08.761Z","release_notes":"New menu item, at the bottom, to \"Disable alarms\".  This will keep your alarm definitions around but will disable all of them.  Introduced some new screens related to this, just to make it clear when alarms are disabled.  If you do \"show alarms\", they will appear in parentheses to show they're disabled.  If you do \"show next alarm\", it will say they're disabled.\r\n\r\nMade some changes to make sure it clearly displays when an alarm is being pushed out by one or more days, displaying the time and then \"+1\", \"+2\", etc.\r\n\r\nFixed a bug where the program wasn't saving the actual alarm times, so if you restarted the program, it wouldn't remember that an alarm had been pushed out by a day or so.  It now saves this information.\r\n"},{"version":"1.3","published_date":"2015-12-12T04:48:25.887Z","release_notes":"This version should correctly insert and remove timeline pins. It also allows a choice of four different fonts."}],"companions":{"ios":null,"android":null},"compatibility":{"ios":{"supported":true,"min_js_version":-1},"android":{"supported":true},"aplite":{"supported":true,"firmware":{"major":3}},"basalt":{"supported":true,"firmware":{"major":3}},"chalk":{"supported":true,"firmware":{"major":3}},"diorite":{"supported":true,"firmware":{"major":3}},"emery":{"supported":true,"firmware":{"major":3}}},"created_at":"2015-10-24T23:01:17.016Z","description":"Daily alarms with custom notes, automatically rescheduled to the next day.  Great for taking various different pills on a daily basis.  (Do not rely totally on these reminders.  Bugs may be present, even though I have tried to verify correct working in many situations.).
