(https://github.com/chadrien/pebble-watchface-text-watch-aurebesh) Now it has been reborn into SDK 2.x for OG Pebble and a colored version for SDK 3.x on Pebble Time. Now included is a Bluetooth indicator in the lower left corner (letters \"BT\" in Aurebesh) that changes to \"NO\" on OG Pebble when disconnected but just changes to red on Pebble Time when disconnected. In lower left corner is Pebble battery indicator in numbers (shows as \"+\"% when charging).
