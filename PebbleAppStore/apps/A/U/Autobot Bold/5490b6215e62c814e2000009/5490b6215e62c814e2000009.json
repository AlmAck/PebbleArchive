Shows time, day of month, and day of week.\r\n\r\nThis watchface expects you to have a bluetooth device connected to the watch.  When the watch loses connection, it buzzes up to three times (one per minute) warning you that you have left bluetooth range of the connected device.  This is to prevent you from losing your phone.\r\n\r\nIf you do not have a bluetooth device, just ignore the buzzing until the 3rd warning, and it will go away.\r\n\r\nCurrently in testing to make sure that battery use is minimized.  Updates possible.\r\n\r\n","developer_id":"54876d60d46a6173850000ff","hearts":16,"id":"5490b6215e62c814e2000009","latest_release":{"id":"54930183b7c253e546000103","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/XsAmwi7jSkCveY0RHmBw","published_date":"2014-12-18T16:33:13.042Z","release_notes":"Update to optimize code and battery use.\r\nAdded second pulse to autobot logo.
