Included in this version are Mega Asbol, Lanturn, Azumarill, and Luxray. Shake to animate each sprite for 10 seconds.\r\n\r\nWith the release of sun and moon, gen 7 sprites can also be added! Feel free to let me know if you would like this watchface with new Pokemon.\r\n\r\nDue to limitations of the Pebble software, manual changes are required to change Pokemon. Find the code on Github to make your own personal watch, or feel free to email me for directions. If you can't seem to figure it out, email me with the 4 pokemon you would like, and I can send you a PBW file which you can load onto your watch.\r\n\r\nThanks to pkpara√≠so for hosting sprites\r\n\r\nGithub link: https://github.com/a-spo/AnimatedDex","developer_id":"570af466235d5ac80f000006","header_images":"","hearts":29,"id":"5723a8c7801d31f15900000c","latest_release":{"id":"5727c7fdded357e6bc00000e","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/iaYZ7mELRrOeFGwevkD2","published_date":"2016-05-02T21:49:28.780Z","release_notes":"First Full Release\r\n\r\nRotate between four animations.
