This can be done by setting the Pebble in 24 hrs format and reading in 24 hrs using the digital box; and reading the 12 hrs mode using the analog hands.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!  :)\r\n\r\n","developer_id":"5327d89581f6bae5f00000b5","header_images":"","hearts":15,"id":"57bccb05f01b53329a000c2a","latest_release":{"id":"57bcce86bb85edfa5600012b","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/uQCDnaASWbzRu3GJoVTQ","published_date":"2016-08-23T22:30:44.289Z","release_notes":"","version":"1.0"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57bccb05f01b53329a000c2a/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57bccb05f01b53329a000c2a/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57bccb05f01b53329a000c2a/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57bccb05f01b53329a000c2a/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57bccb05f01b53329a000c2a/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57bccb05f01b53329a000c2a/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/57bccb05f01b53329a000c2a"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/8xY2BD3URe4W9qQkQiAF/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/8xY2BD3URe4W9qQkQiAF/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2016-08-23T22:32:08.607Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/8xY2BD3URe4W9qQkQiAF/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"Ana/Digi Round","type":"watchface","uuid":"1f6e82e0-22b7-4062-b7cf-705a9ea2e6ef","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
