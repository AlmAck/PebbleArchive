There is no goal or objective, just walking around and seeing the Pebble's ability to render a 3D game.\r\n\r\nUse the accelerometer to move.\r\nTo remain stationary, watch should be flat with screen pointing up\r\nTilt up/down to move forward/backward\r\nTilt left/right to rotate\r\nHold the bottom button and tilt left/right to strafe.\r\nPress the middle button to shoot out walls. (Try going outside!)\r\nPress the top button to generate a random maze.\r\n\r\nThe smiley face guy is just there as a sprite rendering test.  He doesn't do anything besides sit there and be happy.  He knows you cannot harm him.  Currently, sprites only show up in the black and white version.\r\n\r\nI made this over a year ago (posted it to mypebblefaces.com) and planned on fleshing it out into a full fledged game, but I mostly only got negative feedback (nobody wants a 3D game on their watch).  If anybody would like this progressed any further, let me know.  Either way, I may continue to update it from time to time just for fun. I have shared the full source code if anyone wants to learn how this was created.\r\n\r\nSource: https://github.com/robisodd/ ","developer_id":"530273b74b130b71ef000192","header_images":[{"orig":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/Zs0hBGTnRa2vksaQZMmy/convert?cache=true&fit=crop","720x320":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/Zs0hBGTnRa2vksaQZMmy/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=720&h=320"}],"hearts":293,"icon_image":{"28x28":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/GhFgaAWZTFW0LrdbpVUe/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=28&h=28","48x48":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/GhFgaAWZTFW0LrdbpVUe/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=48&h=48"},"id":"557ed8733c562e76c5000021","latest_release":{"id":"55957df97f82439c93000061","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/wbdqZTa3Q1iS7IfDlibO","published_date":"2015-07-02T18:08:19.567Z","release_notes":"v0.12: Color renders 1bit, 2bit and 4bit color textures for the walls and floor/ceiling.
