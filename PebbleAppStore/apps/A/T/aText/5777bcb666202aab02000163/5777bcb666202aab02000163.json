It shows date, a simple battery meter and health data (sleep in the morning, steps after 2000 are reached).\r\n\r\naText features Clay offline configuration for:\r\n- Enable / disable localization (EN, FR, DE, ES, IT, PT)\r\n- Minimum required steps / sleep\r\n- Step goal (watch will vibrate and count will blink on reaching the goal, setting to 0 to turn it off)\r\n- Date format (full ISO or date and weekday)\r\n- Enable / disable high contrast mode on wrist shake\r\n- Text / background color\r\n- Exception color (when required steps / sleep is not reached, or to indicate bluetooth disconnect)\r\n\r\nOn bluetooth disconnect the watch will vibrate and show a status notification instead of the pebble logo.\r\n\r\nShaking the watch will switch to high contrast / BW mode for 3 seconds to achieve better readability in darker environments.\r\n\r\nThis app uses the free \"Antonio Bold\" font, which is licensed under SIL Open Fonts license http://scripts.sil.org/OFL\r\n\r\nI created this watchface for my personal use on a Pebble Time, and I'm sharing it in the hope that it might be useful for you, too. Use at your own risk, and if you have any bug reports or suggestions let me know, I'll see what I can do.","developer_id":"56c56e989a0e12214c00000c","header_images":"","hearts":43,"id":"5777bcb666202aab02000163","latest_release":{"id":"57c7edfcf69d1de23e0006cd","js_md5":"da2cf1d8f3f1bb10de2d86a44c82c18d","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/kYd9Y2ccRA2jLTicIroQ","published_date":"2016-09-01T09:00:16.218Z","release_notes":"- Pebble2 / Diorite compatibility\r\n- Configuration switch to enable / disable high contrast mode on wrist shake","version":"2.3"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5777bcb666202aab02000163/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5777bcb666202aab02000163/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5777bcb666202aab02000163/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5777bcb666202aab02000163/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5777bcb666202aab02000163/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5777bcb666202aab02000163/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/5777bcb666202aab02000163"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/k5ptUnYGRMOGRUW13LZS/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/k5ptUnYGRMOGRUW13LZS/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2016-07-02T13:58:14.500Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/k5ptUnYGRMOGRUW13LZS/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/NW20O9veQ7qxT5teFa1I/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"aText","type":"watchface","uuid":"1994a79d-e811-4182-b03e-4a62a4d72836","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
