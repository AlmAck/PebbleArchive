Yet, it gives info about battery, steps and bluetooth.\r\nFor fitness, try to keep the underlining of the date green!\r\n\r\n+The underlining of the date indicates the number of steps compared to the typical count for that time of the day. That is, a full line indicates that you are walking as much as in a typical day so far. A line that's half the length indicates that you are walking 50% of the steps of a typical day at that time. Lastly, the line turns green if you are walking more than a typical day so far.\r\n+The watch vibrates if Bluetooth connection is lost, and the day name becomes red.\r\n+The day number becomes red if the battery has less than 10% charge*. \r\n+You can configure the numbers, dots and foreground/background colors\r\n\r\n\r\n*Since the watch itself already warns you of low battery levels, I just added this as a permanent reminder to charge the watch ASAP.","developer_id":"57184d5a02a44bd37c000023","header_images":"","hearts":16,"id":"57abfc09f01b53ee0c0000dc","latest_release":{"id":"5833d3968c7fff9ce100022f","js_md5":"4176dc0a1571a67d32063123cbfdcd80","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/ROQqXatjQ0iRBDg1XNQA","published_date":"2016-11-22T05:12:05.215Z","release_notes":"Now with configuration, roman numerals vs. arabic numerals.
