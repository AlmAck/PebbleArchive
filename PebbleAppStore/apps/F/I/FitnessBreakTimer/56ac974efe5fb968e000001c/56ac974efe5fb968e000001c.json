After 60, 90 or 120 seconds (whichever you choose) you will be notified by a gentle vibration on your wrist that it's time to hit the weights again.\r\n\r\nDon't loose track of the number of breaks you've had on any machine ever again. Click the up button for your first break and the down button for every next break. By clicking the up button, you will reset the break counter back to 1.\r\n\r\nChange the duration of the break with the select button. Your last choice will be remembered, even after you close and re-open the app.\r\n\r\nEnjoy your work-outs and relax. This app will do the counting for you!\r\n\r\nIf you like it, heart it ;-)","developer_id":"54df278891a09e5111000078","header_images":[{"orig":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/RumdK9cRB6uWutkl89Ro/convert?cache=true&fit=crop","720x320":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/RumdK9cRB6uWutkl89Ro/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=720&h=320"}],"hearts":31,"icon_image":{"28x28":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/RMFiYkgZS06fglORdtBy/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=28&h=28","48x48":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/RMFiYkgZS06fglORdtBy/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=48&h=48"},"id":"56ac974efe5fb968e000001c","latest_release":{"id":"56f489529b7dcf3f2a000020","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/TDXtNNuYQ3C6i00A7Eer","published_date":"2016-03-25T00:42:16.620Z","release_notes":"FitnessTimer is now compatible with all Pebble models.","version":"1.3"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56ac974efe5fb968e000001c/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56ac974efe5fb968e000001c/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56ac974efe5fb968e000001c/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56ac974efe5fb968e000001c/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56ac974efe5fb968e000001c/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56ac974efe5fb968e000001c/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/56ac974efe5fb968e000001c"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/36j0gi9tRluQTYqs7NE8/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/36j0gi9tRluQTYqs7NE8/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2016-01-30T11:30:10.275Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/0AmRfne6SWUGyN1Mt5BQ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/p6AyO2EwR22YVdNM6L7F/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/XR6phrdZSrWhllZynEYT/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/nBpK7OwfQ1C4tMCdL1sZ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/zQ15kUZBQeeSSEc2MWow/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"FitnessBreakTimer","type":"watchapp","uuid":"4652ad58-ec47-49cd-9956-c073b12c42d6","website":"https://www.tisferry.com/pebble/fitnesstimer.php"}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
