The coding isn't the best. Vibrates and updates corresponding parts of screen on Bluetooth connect and disconnect along with charger connect and disconnect. Has a basic analog clock which uses a large dot to signify the hour (always points to the current hour number (1 - 12) - updates each hour) and a smaller dot to signify the minutes (only points to the current minute number (1 - 12) - updates every five minutes.). Includes a digital clock, local weather in Fahrenheit, and a bar that grows every ten seconds to act as a second hand. Also displays day of week and date. 12 or 24 hour format depending on watch settings. \r\n\r\nThis is the colored version of my original face, Faze.\r\nThis face has three themes that can be cycled through by flicking the pebble downwards with its face pointing towards the ceiling.
