You also get eight predefined color themes as well as ability to set each color individually. This face also provides weather and fitness tracking at your fingertips. And it just looks cool.\r\n\r\nKey features:\r\n\r\n- Digital or Analog face type selection\r\n- Multiple color themes as well as custom color settings (or you can leave it on auto and the color will depend on battery level)\r\n- Weather (powered by Forecast.io), Step Counter, Distance Walked, Sleep Hours\r\n- Bluetooth Connect/Disconnect alert of configurable intensity with visual clue\r\n- Battery level represented by percentage number as well as visually by outer perimeter of dots (also by watchface color - if in auto color mode).\r\n- Visual step goals\r\n\r\nAfter installing watchface you have a 3-day trial period to explore all the features and different aspects. At the end of trial if you like Future Time and want to keep it - it's just $0.99 USD via Kiezel Pay payment system, you will be prompted to enter code and follow few easy payment steps. Once purchased - the watchface is yours permanently, no matter what Pebble or what phone you use, as long as you keep the same Pebble account.\r\n\r\nYou will need to get free key for weather services at https://developer.forecast.io - this is one time procedure.\r\n\r\nDesign by Paul Joel http://www.pauljoel.com","developer_id":"52f547605101128b2200005a","header_images":"","hearts":389,"id":"56e04296320b573560000009","latest_release":{"id":"57d2f1d7ffca4965f40000a2","js_md5":"29383f83bd602a289abcd2e7ab74ba05","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/X5ewdcoSZiDih2w4e9qE","published_date":"2016-09-09T17:31:09.840Z","release_notes":"- fixed misaligned digital time on PTR","version":"1.55"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56e04296320b573560000009/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56e04296320b573560000009/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56e04296320b573560000009/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56e04296320b573560000009/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56e04296320b573560000009/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56e04296320b573560000009/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/56e04296320b573560000009"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/cH4QWKqAQa6NJrZafW9L/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/cH4QWKqAQa6NJrZafW9L/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2016-03-09T20:26:43.628Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/cH4QWKqAQa6NJrZafW9L/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/2JvMgKaXQ9uddYIud5pb/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/GbPFod9SLatPBPIK3sRQ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/wHPgT43iSjKA260kK8LL/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/6jpaR2R2TWygeOq6kjVN/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"Future Time","type":"watchface","uuid":"332d406c-98c2-4c36-85cb-fc0ef7d444c5","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
