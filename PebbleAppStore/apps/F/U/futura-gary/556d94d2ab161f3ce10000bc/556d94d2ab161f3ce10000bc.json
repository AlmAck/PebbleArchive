The weather symbol next to the date is the current conditions. The 5 symbols along the bottom are the 5 day forecast starting with the forecast for the rest of today. Battery level and charge indicator. Tap events cause a weather update. Power saving mode, where if the watch is still for a while (such as when not attached to an arm) then still mode is entered and battery saving happens by not updating the weather every 15 minutes. When leaving still mode the weather is updated immediately. A weather update is never done when the last one was within 3 minutes. For temperatures, the trend up or down is also indicated. Time when the last weather update happened is shown. Reduced power consumption by not having a time and display update every second, now it is every minute and only switches to every second for 10 seconds following a weather update event. Quick vibrate on the hour and every 15 minutes. Wakes up and update on bringing the watch up to your face. This app is open source, and based on the great Futura Weather 2, but with many additional features and a completely redesigned display.","developer_id":"52f143208d40befc3a000105","header_images":"","hearts":16,"id":"556d94d2ab161f3ce10000bc","latest_release":{"id":"5581f7319e9090792700001f","js_md5":"de8a983c539630bd4250e4f8418ee24c","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/De9Wa6n7TBCuzMQAY0lK","published_date":"2015-06-17T22:40:44.755Z","release_notes":"Removed the settings option which was just hanging.
