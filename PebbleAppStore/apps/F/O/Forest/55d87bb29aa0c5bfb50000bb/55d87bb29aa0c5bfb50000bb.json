During this time, the daytime view is always shown.   Please be patient if it's night-time.\r\n\r\nIf you change location and the sunrise/sunset times change significantly, you would have to either wait until the next day for them to be picked up correctly or press the middle button and back with the left button\r\n\r\nFinally, some thanks:\r\n-  to Sam Jerichow for help with the background images \r\n- to Vladimir Agafonkin whose SunCalc JavaScript library enables calculation of  sun position, sunlight phases, moon position and lunar phase for the given location and time\r\n- to Andy Barry who used SunCalc in his version of Simplday watchface - I borrowed some of his code in my Javascript\r\n","developer_id":"54547c1fe77c14d0a1000033","header_images":"","hearts":34,"id":"55d87bb29aa0c5bfb50000bb","latest_release":{"id":"55d87d31276b2015d20000b7","js_md5":"3bafa3395657199e315672ec965eface","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/L9JYvX0Ty6xstCv8ZhQA","published_date":"2015-08-22T13:46:39.949Z","release_notes":"Version 2 adds support of black and white Pebbles","version":"2.0"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55d87bb29aa0c5bfb50000bb/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55d87bb29aa0c5bfb50000bb/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55d87bb29aa0c5bfb50000bb/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55d87bb29aa0c5bfb50000bb/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55d87bb29aa0c5bfb50000bb/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55d87bb29aa0c5bfb50000bb/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/55d87bb29aa0c5bfb50000bb"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/kNCY39dQ4WYPiND1HlpC/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/kNCY39dQ4WYPiND1HlpC/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-08-22T13:46:46.217Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/kNCY39dQ4WYPiND1HlpC/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/1HCQTP2OQCB5TnEMVCYj/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/nhaXHiY0SlGaNLLEID8i/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/SBdYUIclTXObUvfx45Eq/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"Forest","type":"watchface","uuid":"e971ff9c-e1e5-4a96-a01c-f5e1bbcd7a66","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
