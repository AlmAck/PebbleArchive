The AHA recommends taking at least 10,000 steps per day.\r\n\r\nIf displaying your step count is enabled, your step count will be replaced by your sleep duration and displayed for 30 minutes when you wake up, as detected by Pebble Health. Detection is delayed by 5 minutes.\r\n\r\nOther optional settings:\r\n\r\nHourly vibrate with per hour pattern.\r\nShow/Hide date and week.\r\nIncrease date size.\r\nIcon and vibrate on bluetooth lost.\r\nTurn on backlight with casual arm gesture.\r\n\r\nThe face is squeezed during Timeline Peek.","developer_id":"547a03513f44377417000034","header_images":"","hearts":1307,"id":"56efc6a7b07e357aef00004f","latest_release":{"id":"583942ef00355a4bea00011d","js_md5":"619db5eca8d71c84daf0fbc2a1531313","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/33vT2eWOSke7cv6aIAv5","published_date":"2016-11-26T08:08:55.125Z","release_notes":"Added indicator for when Quiet Time is on.","version":"1.12"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56efc6a7b07e357aef00004f/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56efc6a7b07e357aef00004f/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56efc6a7b07e357aef00004f/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56efc6a7b07e357aef00004f/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56efc6a7b07e357aef00004f/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56efc6a7b07e357aef00004f/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/56efc6a7b07e357aef00004f"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/Wn2zo34FTwuUw2lAEHVl/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/Wn2zo34FTwuUw2lAEHVl/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2016-03-21T12:19:52.185Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/Wn2zo34FTwuUw2lAEHVl/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/JkeBxmiT2mvqcVCDSgs2/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/XKxXrJjvQjeVoheuZTFP/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/ZCESynIaSAOIiqdc6uQi/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/9Ziqhcm7RY6nUn7GIpBQ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"Fourier","type":"watchface","uuid":"415f7861-7f83-4dfd-a00e-b26d554f65f2","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
