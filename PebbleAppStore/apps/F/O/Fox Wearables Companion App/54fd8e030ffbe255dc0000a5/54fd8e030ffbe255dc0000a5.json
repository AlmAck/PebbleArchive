The Fox Insight Trial is an online clinical study to gather the world's largest collection of data about daily life with Parkinson's disease directly from people living with the disease. For more information about joining the trial please contact wear@foxinsight.org The Fox Insight Wear app collects data about various aspects of your movement. You can also directly report to the app (such as “I took medication”), to help interpret movement data and provide additional insights. The app can help you better understand your own patterns and trends. In addition, your data is transmitted anonymously to researchers who are developing methods for detecting and measuring PD motor symptoms for evaluation of new treatments, and increased understanding of disease progression.","developer_id":"54fd8c31ea06cc037c0000c8","header_images":[{"orig":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/NXXpOEkmQ625I2eoeCBq/convert?cache=true&fit=crop","720x320":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/NXXpOEkmQ625I2eoeCBq/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=720&h=320"}],"hearts":54,"icon_image":{"28x28":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/ArD4fJvGQojnxNcldU9C/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=28&h=28","48x48":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/ArD4fJvGQojnxNcldU9C/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=48&h=48"},"id":"54fd8e030ffbe255dc0000a5","latest_release":{"id":"57ed0289fc5ff1e644000016","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/YEI6rYUvQxW6O2YFDsOT","published_date":"2016-11-17T14:49:17.191Z","release_notes":"","version":"3.1"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54fd8e030ffbe255dc0000a5/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54fd8e030ffbe255dc0000a5/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54fd8e030ffbe255dc0000a5/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54fd8e030ffbe255dc0000a5/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54fd8e030ffbe255dc0000a5/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54fd8e030ffbe255dc0000a5/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/54fd8e030ffbe255dc0000a5"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/VUqhwgfqTyK1NfqL6Z0l/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/VUqhwgfqTyK1NfqL6Z0l/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-05-12T16:10:18.348Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/475bL8ISKHuaGwM438gQ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"Fox Wearables Companion App","type":"watchapp","uuid":"69725cc2-892a-44f5-b05f-ff6d69a099f5","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
