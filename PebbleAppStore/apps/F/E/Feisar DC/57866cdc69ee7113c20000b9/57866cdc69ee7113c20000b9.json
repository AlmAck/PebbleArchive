Blue hand is for hours and gray one for minutes. You can see temperature on the left circle and day on the right circle. You also have an small green or red dot for checking bluetooth conectivity. It vibrates if get disconected. Sorry but Im not going to create a setting page to change anything. \r\n\r\nAs always this is a free WatchFace.
