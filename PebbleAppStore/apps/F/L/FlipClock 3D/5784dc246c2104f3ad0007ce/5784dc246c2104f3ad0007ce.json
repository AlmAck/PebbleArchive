speeds: shake motions (the spin-up gesture) closer than 3 seconds apart will now be ignored.\r\n\r\n2) Spin speed max limit also introduced to prevent spin speeds that would take too long to bleed-out (wasting too much battery).\r\n\r\n3) Flip digit animation length reduced to 25 frames (1 sec) also to save on battery."},{"version":"4.3","published_date":"2016-10-04T14:59:29.095Z","release_notes":"Font change discarded.\r\nEvery vigorous shake will now just increase the spinning
