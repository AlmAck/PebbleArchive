It actually moves every minute at half of the speed of the minute hand.\r\n\r\nIt shows date with the weekday in your current language (English and Spanish work fine, others should also do, please tell me if your language works fine) \r\nBackground is green if bluethooth is connected, red if not. \r\nIt also vibrates if it loses or gains bluethooth connectivity. \r\n\r\nSee my \"Floating Date Square\" watchface for fitting non-round watches, like the Pebble Time, and Pebble Time Steel watches.","developer_id":"5327d89581f6bae5f00000b5","header_images":"","hearts":17,"id":"577fee0c6c2104f3ad00040f","latest_release":{"id":"577fee3966202a9b8d000429","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/Wk2eq4MBScOcajQMpten","published_date":"2016-07-08T18:17:47.040Z","release_notes":"","version":"1.0"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/577fee0c6c2104f3ad00040f/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/577fee0c6c2104f3ad00040f/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/577fee0c6c2104f3ad00040f/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/577fee0c6c2104f3ad00040f/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/577fee0c6c2104f3ad00040f/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/577fee0c6c2104f3ad00040f/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/577fee0c6c2104f3ad00040f"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/QLG5AG5QHOh03RO3OOWf/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/QLG5AG5QHOh03RO3OOWf/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2016-07-08T18:28:56.437Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/QLG5AG5QHOh03RO3OOWf/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/ZKHlBBfRfaE1TOlNnTKQ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/ueWXzZeJSSWoPGWvlXsg/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"Floating Date","type":"watchface","uuid":"118449d4-56ee-4156-b4e8-7e52679165fc","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
