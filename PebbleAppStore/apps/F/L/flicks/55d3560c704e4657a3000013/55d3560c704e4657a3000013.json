(NO PORT, NO HTTP://)\r\n- Connect the phone to the same network as the server.\r\n\r\nConfiguration and Scripting\r\nThe config.js file is the meat of the application. It includes examples that should function on most Windows computers. \r\n\r\nflicks will work on any OS - modify the configuration any way you want - it's fairly self-explanatory but a full documentation will come within a few updates.You can call entire scripts just like you would from the command line. Don't forget to restart server.js when you make changes to config.js!\r\n\r\nControls \r\nHere's the fun part. Upon boot, the Pebble will grab your configuration from the server and display the first one on the screen. To activate it - either flick your wrist or press select. You'll see a dot at the bottom right when you activate commands. When it goes away and the watch vibrates, execution was completed. You can cycle through your functions with the up/down buttons, and if you long-press select it will refresh the configuration from the server or reconnect.\r\n\r\nDocumentation available @ https://gitlab.com/n4ru/Flicks\r\n\r\nPlease report any bugs or feature requests!","developer_id":"52c5a1cc0a89c8025a000049","header_images":[{"orig":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/jwJNeDNsTou0Rus6pr5M/convert?cache=true&fit=crop","720x320":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/jwJNeDNsTou0Rus6pr5M/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=720&h=320"}],"hearts":40,"icon_image":{"28x28":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/GUHG2PWTciaOnUAMdufL/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=28&h=28","48x48":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/GUHG2PWTciaOnUAMdufL/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=48&h=48"},"id":"55d3560c704e4657a3000013","latest_release":{"id":"560ad87abc8d7cceb100006f","js_md5":"b66292fc54afad45d4fe524ec3e2a3c1","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/03SBVpehQheD9u7VjOTA","published_date":"2015-09-29T18:34:39.958Z","release_notes":"","version":"0.05"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55d3560c704e4657a3000013/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55d3560c704e4657a3000013/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55d3560c704e4657a3000013/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55d3560c704e4657a3000013/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55d3560c704e4657a3000013/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55d3560c704e4657a3000013/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/55d3560c704e4657a3000013"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/8ObGbn1uREWLFHRmgNNJ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/8ObGbn1uREWLFHRmgNNJ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-08-18T16:40:56.732Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/7zJvg1CaSwuOKwvyUZzd/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/VYNJjnwvQl2oBsX2sbLU/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"https://gitlab.com/n4ru/Flicks","title":"flicks","type":"watchapp","uuid":"681a5956-9f3c-4dfe-9628-7e9bf128b46f","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
