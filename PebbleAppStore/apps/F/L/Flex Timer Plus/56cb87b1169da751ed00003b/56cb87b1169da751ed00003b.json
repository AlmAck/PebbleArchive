All colors can be changed in the settings page.\r\n\r\nNormal use case would be to start the Work Timer when you arrive at work, pause it when you go to break. Keeps track of current break and total break time. Then, when you get to enough hours for the day, go home. \r\n\r\nTo enable the Weather options you will need an API key from Open Weather Map\r\nYou can get a free API key here:\r\n https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up\r\n\r\n\r\n","developer_id":"54a4c30ade4051095e00015f","header_images":"","hearts":5,"icon_image":{"28x28":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/EVzNqg3dRlGrsSw0Xvnd/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=28&h=28","48x48":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/EVzNqg3dRlGrsSw0Xvnd/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=48&h=48"},"id":"56cb87b1169da751ed00003b","latest_release":{"id":"5821fa39e7785b951900008b","js_md5":"a4c2cc47ad1d4dadaf8608df6999ee69","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/hzAojsCDRBSQjjnVi47g","published_date":"2016-11-08T16:16:09.578Z","release_notes":"This is it!
