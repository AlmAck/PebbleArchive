In this watchface, they are pixelated to the max, until they are almost unrecognizeable. Almost. The result is a set of numbers made of 2x3 pixels which are still distinguishable by the position and the brightness of their pixels. The rule is: the more lines are in that area, the stronger the pixel. \r\n\r\nLow resolution doesn't mean low quality. There are pixels everywhere these days. It's a cool artistic way to describe reality.\r\n\r\nDesign / Programming / Copyright Â© 2012, 2015 Sam Jerichow \r\n\r\nThanks to Nev Rawlins for his support!","developer_id":"54ed03c2d9c53b312f00010f","header_images":"","hearts":16,"id":"5565fa66f1a1c766dc000075","latest_release":{"id":"5565fed8f1a1c7e50d00008b","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/CLFEpehLRBWUbEVF2JLK","published_date":"2015-05-27T17:30:28.050Z","release_notes":"","version":"1.0"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5565fa66f1a1c766dc000075/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5565fa66f1a1c766dc000075/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5565fa66f1a1c766dc000075/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5565fa66f1a1c766dc000075/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5565fa66f1a1c766dc000075/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5565fa66f1a1c766dc000075/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/5565fa66f1a1c766dc000075"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/3te9KB0ITf66LIafbVX0/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/3te9KB0ITf66LIafbVX0/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-05-27T17:31:00.268Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/3te9KB0ITf66LIafbVX0/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/3OK0nea8Ttmxs4lnXsaf/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/5pojj1jlTZiDN0kH4qhC/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/yIr9l2MQSmKOVvjRHIoP/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/zmtrfloSSha05TP1e0so/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"Pixel Intensity M","type":"watchface","uuid":"06319252-4781-4833-bb03-95d7fd4dde21","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
