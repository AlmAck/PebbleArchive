In this watchface, they are pixelated to the max, until they are almost unrecognizeable. Almost. The result is a set of numbers made of 2x3 pixels which are still distinguishable by the position and the brightness of their pixels. The rule is: the more lines are in that area, the stronger the pixel. Low resolution doesn't mean low quality. There are pixels everywhere these days. It's a cool artistic way to describe reality. \r\n\r\nDesign / Programming / Copyright Â© 2012, 2015 Sam Jerichow\r\n\r\nAgain, thanks to Nev Rawlins for his support!","developer_id":"54ed03c2d9c53b312f00010f","header_images":"","hearts":24,"id":"5572e1d73b1d51d8df000032","latest_release":{"id":"5572e2b13b1d51816b000034","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/QQNjtJ81RgaNXiIgkWDi","published_date":"2015-06-06T12:08:44.236Z","release_notes":"","version":"1.0"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5572e1d73b1d51d8df000032/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5572e1d73b1d51d8df000032/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5572e1d73b1d51d8df000032/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5572e1d73b1d51d8df000032/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5572e1d73b1d51d8df000032/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5572e1d73b1d51d8df000032/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/5572e1d73b1d51d8df000032"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/XaZ1MrOOTQS05SHlpVOA/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/XaZ1MrOOTQS05SHlpVOA/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-06-06T12:08:51.764Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/XaZ1MrOOTQS05SHlpVOA/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/Vk0KG2pTq6f4U0iOaLwW/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/vvrYsRGdTqurCZWJyJEl/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/44eQkRrIQVK4lN9IDMhw/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/G5b6ie8ITaOeO6YBND3m/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"Pixel Intensity C","type":"watchface","uuid":"53d15ecf-45c7-4759-918a-16fa6aa5c188","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
