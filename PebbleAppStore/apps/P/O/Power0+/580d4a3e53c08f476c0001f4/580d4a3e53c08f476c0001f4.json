Yeah, that watchface that will save power but still let you have a cool look? Oh, and remember Power1? Uh-huh, that watchface that gave you some more information but still saved your power? Well, Power0+ is you combination of those two!\r\nPower0+ displays your time the same way that Power0 did but now the date is displayed at the bottom and your battery level is displayed (in percents) at the top. These newly added figures are still in a font that uses as little pixel as possible to maximize the no-power-neededness of the Power watchfaces.\r\n\r\nPlease heart this watchface if you liked it, and please feel free to send feedback or suggestions for improvement.\r\n\r\nThanks!!\r\n~MicroBob","developer_id":"5769ae3a3feaee4aa30004b2","header_images":"","hearts":7,"id":"580d4a3e53c08f476c0001f4","latest_release":{"id":"580d4abbe19568309c00023b","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/mHEPk6fESpiMh0Q36VBn","published_date":"2016-10-24T00:16:42.612Z","release_notes":"","version":"1.0"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/580d4a3e53c08f476c0001f4/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/580d4a3e53c08f476c0001f4/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/580d4a3e53c08f476c0001f4/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/580d4a3e53c08f476c0001f4/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/580d4a3e53c08f476c0001f4/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/580d4a3e53c08f476c0001f4/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/580d4a3e53c08f476c0001f4"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/N8sVCsc2QfS6nsAlLLC2/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/N8sVCsc2QfS6nsAlLLC2/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2016-10-24T00:17:37.379Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/N8sVCsc2QfS6nsAlLLC2/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"Power0+","type":"watchface","uuid":"514eeebe-0880-46c2-acea-fbf488ff2b7c","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
