I've got a lot of requests for pebble classic and pebble time round versions, but I don't have the time. If anyone has any pebble.js skills, consider contributing to https://github.com/tetrapus/PoGoPebble\r\n\r\n/!\\ This is the watchface version of the app. For the watchapp with more interactivity, see https://apps.getpebble.com/en_US/application/5798e5b11482cdda2b0000c8\r\n\r\nWhat's new:\r\n- Night mode (Enable Backlight) in the settings menu enables the backlight when you lock onto a Pokemon. Best for night time pokemon hunting!\r\n- Add a new setting to temporarily disable priority settings, for when you just want to catch 'em all.\r\n\r\nFixes:\r\n- Vibrate when the active pokemon enters the alert range, not just on first appearance\r\n- Fix search bar so it isn't terrible\r\n- Fix undefined settings before first config\r\n\r\nOptimisations:\r\n- Optimised more pokemon sprites"},{"version":"1.2","published_date":"2016-07-28T03:49:47.876Z","release_notes":"Fix duplicate pokemon bug"},{"version":"1.1","published_date":"2016-07-27T18:03:41.880Z","release_notes":"This release includes an improved search interface, and the ability to lock the active pokemon.\r\n\r\nShake your watch to lock a pokemon, and shake again to release.\r\n\r\nFor full navigational features, check out the watchapp version of this release, which includes scrolling through pokemon, dismissing pokemon, and changing pokemon priority, available at https://apps.getpebble.com/en_US/application/5798e5b11482cdda2b0000c8\r\n\r\nI'll be maintaining both versions, so feel free to decide which way you like to use it better. A battery saving mode and better alert presets is coming in a future version to make it more suitable for every-day use.
