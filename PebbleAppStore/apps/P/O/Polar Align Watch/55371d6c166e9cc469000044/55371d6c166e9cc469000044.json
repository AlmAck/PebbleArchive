If so, you know the importance of starting with a good basic polar alignment. This Polar Align Watchface is used to assist performing a Polar Alignment on an Equatorial Mount with a Polar Finder Scope installed.  \r\n\r\nWhen launched, the Polar Align Watch shows the position of Polaris relative to the North Celestial Pole as seen through a Polar Finder Scope. This watchface enables you to manually adjust the Altitude and Azimuth of the telescope mount to \"move\" Polaris as seen through the Polar Finder Scope to the watchface's indicated point on the circle of the Finder Scope (without having to rotate the telescope around the polar axis to match the sky position). \r\n\r\nThe Polar Align Watch also displays the current local time in 24 hour format and the Month/Day to assist entering time and date information into the telescope hand controller if needed.\r\n\r\nFor more detail information, see my 4/22/2015 post on the blog tab at RemoteVideoAstronomy.com.","developer_id":"54ee24a9a019af61bd0000bc","hearts":5,"id":"55371d6c166e9cc469000044","latest_release":{"id":"55371df1166e9c1a04000036","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/GZApLrbPROC1X1iPYKZZ","published_date":"2015-04-22T04:06:44.803Z","release_notes":"","version":"1.0"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55371d6c166e9cc469000044/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55371d6c166e9cc469000044/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55371d6c166e9cc469000044/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55371d6c166e9cc469000044/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55371d6c166e9cc469000044/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55371d6c166e9cc469000044/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/55371d6c166e9cc469000044"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/iA6yJbWS1yIsureXlS1W/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/iA6yJbWS1yIsureXlS1W/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-04-22T04:11:16.678Z","screenshot_hardware":"aplite","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/iA6yJbWS1yIsureXlS1W/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/rGlSnuN3SKaBEGGk5S65/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"Polar Align Watch","type":"watchface","uuid":"4eda5ddc-2bc4-4231-bd13-0a30327e5fa0","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
