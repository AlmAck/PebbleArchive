I've got a lot of requests for pebble classic and pebble time round versions, but I don't have the time. If anyone has any pebble.js skills, consider contributing to https://github.com/tetrapus/PoGoPebble\r\n\r\nWhat's new:\r\n- Night mode (Enable Backlight) in the settings menu enables the backlight when you lock onto a Pokemon. Best for night time pokemon hunting!\r\n- Add a new setting to temporarily disable priority settings, for when you just want to catch 'em all.\r\n- Infinite scroll lets you scroll past the end of the nearby list. Proper scrolling animations coming soon.\r\n\r\nFixes:\r\n- Vibrate when the active pokemon enters the alert range, not just on first appearance\r\n- Fix search bar so it isn't terrible\r\n- Fix undefined settings before first config\r\n\r\nOptimisations:\r\n- Optimised more pokemon sprites"},{"version":"1.1","published_date":"2016-07-28T03:49:37.382Z","release_notes":"Fix duplicate pokemon bug"},{"version":"1.0","published_date":"2016-07-27T17:15:28.718Z","release_notes":"First release of the WatchApp version of PoGoPebble!
