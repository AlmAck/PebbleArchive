In the meantime, we get 3 Poke'mon sprites (1 enemy, 1 normal ally, 1 shiny ally) If you'd like to customize with your own Pokemon choices, feel free to fork this on GitHub and change the resources. I got the sprites from: http://sprites.pokecheck.org/ and converted the GIF to APNG with:http://gif2apng.sourceforge.net/\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to user derfreimann  for sharing the PokeBattle code. \r\n\r\nTags: Pokemon, Nintendo, Pok√©mon\r\n\r\nThis is a fan-made work for no profit and without claims of ownership of anything Pokemon.
