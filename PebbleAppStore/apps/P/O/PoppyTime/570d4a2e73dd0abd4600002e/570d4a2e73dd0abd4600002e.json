This is an analogue style watch face using the Poppy flower as the watch. \r\n\r\nThe hour hand is represented by the light green stem and the minutes are represented by the dark green leaf. \r\n\r\nSupports both the Pebble Time Round and the Pebble Time watches.\r\n\r\nThanks for looking and trying face out. It's my first one ;) thanks to the Pebble community and London meetup group.\r\n","developer_id":"52f1f2f68811340e55001078","header_images":"","hearts":25,"id":"570d4a2e73dd0abd4600002e","latest_release":{"id":"570d4baa4b68d16c81000043","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/Y0NB20L9QQmeamZ7Hjlr","published_date":"2016-04-12T19:33:58.318Z","release_notes":"initial release","version":"1.0"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/570d4a2e73dd0abd4600002e/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/570d4a2e73dd0abd4600002e/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/570d4a2e73dd0abd4600002e/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/570d4a2e73dd0abd4600002e/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/570d4a2e73dd0abd4600002e/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/570d4a2e73dd0abd4600002e/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/570d4a2e73dd0abd4600002e"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/fNT8T9hWRO2JGzN4LapH/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/fNT8T9hWRO2JGzN4LapH/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2016-04-12T19:34:19.566Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/fNT8T9hWRO2JGzN4LapH/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"PoppyTime","type":"watchface","uuid":"9124b2d8-4f05-4f73-a9ba-ad8052042be5","website":"http://poppytime.website/"}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
