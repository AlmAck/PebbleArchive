Your Pebble will then vibrate and turn the background red, indicating that the timer has started. All you have to do now is count 10 heart beats, lowering your arm on the last one!\r\n\r\nPressing the Up Button will open the settings menu. Currently, this only lets you toggle the accelerometer usage, but more settings are on the way. These are also saved for the next time you open PulseCalc!\r\n\r\nIf you are trying to measure a patient’s heart rate, you can use the select button to manually start or stop the timer.\r\n\r\nThe Down Button allows you to toggle how many beats you have to count. If you want accuracy or you have a high heart rate, 10 beats is recommended. If you would like a faster result, there is a 5 beat option.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE:\r\nAutomatic detection assumes your body is upright, and that your watch is on your left hand. Lefties will be accommodated for in the next update, sorry!\r\n\r\nSorry if there are any issues on Time or Time Steel. I only have a Time Round for testing the accelerometer.","developer_id":"56873c3022c220343900006b","header_images":"","hearts":33,"icon_image":{"28x28":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/jJhgzigqQsKPM45IT4F4/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=28&h=28","48x48":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/jJhgzigqQsKPM45IT4F4/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=48&h=48"},"id":"56b025f49c4b20abc4000004","latest_release":{"id":"56b0427d71e347bd61000005","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/zaBL58JTRYmXEQhROJCd","published_date":"2016-02-02T05:47:51.846Z","release_notes":"Initial Release.","version":"1.0"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56b025f49c4b20abc4000004/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56b025f49c4b20abc4000004/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56b025f49c4b20abc4000004/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56b025f49c4b20abc4000004/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56b025f49c4b20abc4000004/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/56b025f49c4b20abc4000004/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/56b025f49c4b20abc4000004"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/qGqN3aAcTpyK80nJL0zR/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/qGqN3aAcTpyK80nJL0zR/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2016-02-02T05:50:56.489Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/hON3SfiTeCxBxxRbcNIQ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"PulseCalc","type":"watchapp","uuid":"828302f5-793e-49fd-91aa-289b68088857","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
