It is an adaptation of Minimalin, but drops the minute indicator, adds ticks for all hours, highlights the current-hour indicator with a larger font, and shows a subtle next hour. The hands and ticks have also been enlarged for easier reading and the date and weather will dodge the hands as needed.\r\n\r\nTime Format: 12-hour only\r\nWeather: Configurable update rate and units.
