You're taking Calculus, but customers at your minimum wage job are still telling you how to make change.\r\n\r\nYou're better than that. Program your mind with +/-, a stupidly simple (yet surprisingly addictive) left-brain exercising piece of gym kit.\r\n\r\n1.) You'll be presented with two random numbers. If the numbers are blue, add. If they're red, subtract.\r\n2.) Select button shows you what you claim you already knew.\r\n3.) Up button lets you work addition problems, down is for subtraction.\r\n\r\nUpdates are coming soon, because you and I both need work on multiplication and division.\r\n\r\n<3 @petegeste","developer_id":"52b224cbcd4183800b00007e","header_images":[{"orig":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/tCnbmFSgOACSrB4qsJ0g/convert?cache=true&fit=crop","720x320":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/tCnbmFSgOACSrB4qsJ0g/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=720&h=320"}],"hearts":22,"icon_image":{"28x28":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/CTq06ybHQfS78hTtqsEs/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=28&h=28","48x48":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/CTq06ybHQfS78hTtqsEs/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=48&h=48"},"id":"55b647c15e0716cd6b00005a","latest_release":{"id":"55b647d92448b311c7000057","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/wWRfNuq2Tmma1NoIdsbC","published_date":"2015-07-27T15:03:38.438Z","release_notes":"","version":"1.0"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55b647c15e0716cd6b00005a/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55b647c15e0716cd6b00005a/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55b647c15e0716cd6b00005a/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55b647c15e0716cd6b00005a/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55b647c15e0716cd6b00005a/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55b647c15e0716cd6b00005a/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/55b647c15e0716cd6b00005a"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/1e2dzL61TeOLyqI2gAVW/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/1e2dzL61TeOLyqI2gAVW/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-07-28T03:05:12.550Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/uIQmOx7gQgCgAZs1nHTO/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/1Vngwm9HTXqWs2IktnRP/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"https://github.com/PGestewitz/Pebble-PlusorMinus","title":"Plus or Minus","type":"watchapp","uuid":"1cac48f7-869e-493e-8143-3063010a937c","website":"https://petegeste.co"}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
