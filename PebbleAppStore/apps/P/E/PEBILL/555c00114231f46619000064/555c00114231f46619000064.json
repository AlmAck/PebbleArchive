PEBILL might be the first virtual buddy on a watch, but for legal reasons, we're really not 100% sure of that.  \r\n\r\nWhat we do know is that PEBILL lives his day to day virtual life doing what a virtual person might do if he were real, even celebrating special weekdays and holidays throughout the year!   This is what we imagined a virtual person might do, but we're probably wrong, it was worth a shot.\r\n\r\nPEBILL works, plays and lives in his virtual world for you to watch and enjoy, which is pretty creepy when you think about it.  \r\n\r\nPEBILL doesn't ask for much, only that you feed him every couple of days if you can remember.  Don't worry though, he'll remind you when you forget!\r\n\r\nSo how much would you pay for a virtual buddy that goes wherever your Pebble goes? How about nothing, that seems fair to us. \r\n\r\nBe sure to share the love by hitting the heart above...  or else PEBILL will have to cry himself to sleep at night.\r\n\r\nPEBILL is compatible with the Original Pebble, Pebble Steel and Pebble Time.","developer_id":"554628fff17601c93800006f","header_images":"","hearts":1846,"id":"555c00114231f46619000064","latest_release":{"id":"57da07192d0cc8673f000037","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/8IchwlbrSYW0yEsxegUv","published_date":"2016-09-15T02:27:59.556Z","release_notes":"Updated for Time 2 compatibility!","version":"2.0"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/555c00114231f46619000064/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/555c00114231f46619000064/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/555c00114231f46619000064/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/555c00114231f46619000064/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/555c00114231f46619000064/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/555c00114231f46619000064/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/555c00114231f46619000064"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/zbkxyRqgRGaPdiq7t1kk/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/zbkxyRqgRGaPdiq7t1kk/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-05-21T14:45:31.012Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/zbkxyRqgRGaPdiq7t1kk/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"PEBILL","type":"watchface","uuid":"2f51b820-09c7-4a6b-9415-78daba24242a","website":"http://forums.getpebble.com/discussion/23134/watchface-meet-pebill-a-virtual-buddy-on-your-wrist"}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
