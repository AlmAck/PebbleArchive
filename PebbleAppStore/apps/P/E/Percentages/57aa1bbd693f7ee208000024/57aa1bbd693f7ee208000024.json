The title for row 1 is \"H:\" (for \"Hours:\") and the denominator is 24. Thus, 16/24 is 66.6% or 2/3 of a day.\r\n\r\nWhen the 12 hrs format is active, the title \"H:\" is replaced for \"am\" or \"pm\" accordingly. Also, the denominator is set to 12, which means that the fraction and the percentage are with respect to just the morning (if am); or just the afternoon-night (if pm).\r\n\r\nExamples 3 and 4 show 4:15:30 pm, now, 4/12 represents 33.3% or 1/3 of the afternoon-nigh.\r\n\r\nThe 2nd row shows that 15 min out of 60 are 25.0% or 1/4 of the hour.\r\nThe 3rd row shows that 30 sec out of 60 are 50.0% or 1/2 of a minute.\r\nThe Day of week is 2/7, this is, tuesday.\r\nThe Day of month is 9/31, i.e., the 9th day of a month with 31 days.\r\nThe Day of year is 222/366, i.e., the 222nd day of a (leap) year.\r\nThe Month is 8/12, i.e., august (2/3 of a year)\r\nFinally, the year (2016) is not compared to anything.\r\n\r\nIf you think about it, this is quite a lot of information, which I hope you find useful, or at least interesting.\r\n\r\nEnjoy it :)","developer_id":"5327d89581f6bae5f00000b5","header_images":"","hearts":25,"id":"57aa1bbd693f7ee208000024","latest_release":{"id":"57aa6c0b693f7eb8dd000058","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/iH6XMt0IRCO2MtINJahr","published_date":"2016-08-09T23:50:00.418Z","release_notes":"","version":"1.0"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57aa1bbd693f7ee208000024/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57aa1bbd693f7ee208000024/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57aa1bbd693f7ee208000024/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57aa1bbd693f7ee208000024/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57aa1bbd693f7ee208000024/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57aa1bbd693f7ee208000024/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/57aa1bbd693f7ee208000024"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/pXDw5NWURFSBKTSIcoBY/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/pXDw5NWURFSBKTSIcoBY/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2016-08-09T23:50:12.839Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/pXDw5NWURFSBKTSIcoBY/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/HW6m70HQFqNo2DxaUd9i/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/XRCT81XnTivmZ8ZAtZQg/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/ilhtwOC6SQiQuXFsEPon/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"Percentages","type":"watchface","uuid":"18dd46a4-b546-4017-babc-a111ab5b5f92","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
