The purpose of this app is to enable easy, quick, and human communication with loved ones. The speaker wears the pebble smartwatch. From the watch the speaker can select words or phrases to express. The listener uses the smartphone to hear what the speaker is saying. The app must be opened up once at the beginning of use and then can run in the background for hours on end. \r\nAdding words to the watch is easy. Open up the app on the watch, open the app on the smartphone and add words as desired. Just type in the word or phrase and press “Add Word” for a computer generated voice, or enter the word and hit “Record” to add your own sounds. \r\nThis app was designed specifically for use by non-verbal individuals and their loved ones to aid in quick communications in a variety of situations. The watch can maintain connectivity with the smartphone up to 10 meters, and the watch itself is durable and water resistance up to 50 meters, ideal for pools, showers and baths. However, the app can be useful for a variety of persons and applications, only limited by one's creativity.  \r\n","developer_id":"5542a00380f0ad0d610000bc","header_images":[{"orig":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/5wNzXU8zTCSpJC7Yfd8w/convert?cache=true&fit=crop","720x320":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/5wNzXU8zTCSpJC7Yfd8w/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=720&h=320"}],"hearts":9,"icon_image":{"28x28":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/pY87ua0IRM6h3WFcj0fg/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=28&h=28","48x48":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/pY87ua0IRM6h3WFcj0fg/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=48&h=48"},"id":"557824714f8d9860dc00001b","latest_release":{"id":"55838089f09a6718b7000052","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/HwxWHMWuTnmEb5EguK8Y","published_date":"2015-06-19T02:40:07.922Z","release_notes":"","version":"1.0"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/557824714f8d9860dc00001b/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/557824714f8d9860dc00001b/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/557824714f8d9860dc00001b/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/557824714f8d9860dc00001b/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/557824714f8d9860dc00001b/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/557824714f8d9860dc00001b/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/557824714f8d9860dc00001b"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/MvMlJj8KT2i7pFUiDy2z/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/MvMlJj8KT2i7pFUiDy2z/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-06-19T02:40:44.281Z","screenshot_hardware":"aplite","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/B1sfG1oLTPm9LVS3UIfa/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"https://github.com/Utsav2/PebbleAndroid","title":"Pebble Speak Easy AAC App","type":"watchapp","uuid":"6b65b8d3-b4f9-4026-a4e7-cfacd4c1d8e3","website":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=utsav2.researchproject"}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
