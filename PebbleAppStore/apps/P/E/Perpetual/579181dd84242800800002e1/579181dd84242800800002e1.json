The 6 markers are ten minute markers.\r\n\r\nIn between the 12 o'clock mark and the 2 o'clock  mark is the AM/PM indicator. The dot is white during the AM and turns black in the PM.\r\n\r\nThe Date is represented by a red circle which resides on the outer ring of 30 + 1 circles. The 10-minute markers make it easier to read the date. For example the marker on the 30th minute indicates the 15th of the month (30รท2=15).\r\n\r\nThe Month resides as a red dot in the central ring. The dot's position on the dial represents the current month. For example, if the dot is on the 6th hour, the month is June. At 2 o'clock the date would be February. At 12 o'clock, its December.\r\n\r\nThe Day of the Week resides at the lower half of the circle as black dots. The current day of the week is represented by a red dot. It starts at the second marker (20 minutes) at Sunday. At the 6th hour mark, it would be Wednesday. On the 8th hour mark it would be Saturday.\r\n\r\nThe watch will vibrate (long-long-short) when bluetooth is disconnected. Or you can disable that behaviour.\r\n\r\nMake it yours by customizing every color or choose from one of the defined themes.\r\nYou can also use a metal texture style of the background color.\r\n\r\nScreenshot examples:\r\n1) Monday, March 31, 11:25 PM\r\n2) Monday, September 1, 3:00 AM\r\n3) Wednesday, November 20, 5:25 AM\r\n4) Saturday, July 23, 12:00 AM\r\n\r\nThe design is inspired by Ludwig Oechslin's Perpetual Calendar.","developer_id":"5722b3d1db5a405aa4000023","header_images":"","hearts":35,"id":"579181dd84242800800002e1","latest_release":{"id":"57f8fec456fda546f1000024","js_md5":"7993be7acc984e8c3d5d51e54c8b8b40","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/sF6HiEmQQcOZXO4nN4FG","published_date":"2016-10-08T14:12:27.776Z","release_notes":"","version":"2.1"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/579181dd84242800800002e1/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/579181dd84242800800002e1/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/579181dd84242800800002e1/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/579181dd84242800800002e1/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/579181dd84242800800002e1/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/579181dd84242800800002e1/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/579181dd84242800800002e1"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/HoxDaWQbSD6fXuDm78LA/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/HoxDaWQbSD6fXuDm78LA/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2016-07-22T02:49:19.659Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/HoxDaWQbSD6fXuDm78LA/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/0xTgYi8gR8SAP4Errt5G/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/NqQpOZIjR0OY6kxEBoCe/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/m2DiwRbcTzCz8HboZlvr/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"https://github.com/zealotree/Perpetual","title":"Perpetual","type":"watchface","uuid":"48e3dd66-1f18-4a63-8957-8b21a9d8d86d","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
