Day of week will turn white when battery is less than 20%, and bottom left indicator will turn red if Bluetooth connection is lost. Character background randomly chosen on startup and every 5 subsequent minutes. No memory leaks.\r\n\r\nOpenWeatherMap has a tendency to always report Haze in coastal locations. I cannot do anything about it but file a bug report with them, which I did.\r\n\r\nIf the weather circle is empty, OpenWeatherMap is returning an unrecognized weather code. An automatic report mechanism is built in and I will take a look as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nI no longer have a Pebble Time, so no new development will be made. There are no memory leaks or bugs I'm aware of.\r\n\r\nUsing some assets from Th3Laugh1ngMan's Rainmeter skin.\r\nSHIN MEGAMI TENSEI, SMT, and Persona are registered trademarks of Atlus U.S.A., Inc.\r\nUsing OpenWeatherMap data.
