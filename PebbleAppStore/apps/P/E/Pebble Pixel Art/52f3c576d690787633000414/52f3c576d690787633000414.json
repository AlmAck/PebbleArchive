Firmware v3.3 of the Pebble Time appears to change the RNG algorithm such that Pebble Pixel Art's image generation suddeny started creating highly similar triplets of images. This update compensates by doing some trickery to try to make the values appear to be more random before using them again."},{"version":"3.0","published_date":"2015-07-29T15:45:01.932Z","release_notes":"- Upgraded to SDK3 to include native support for Pebble Time and Pebble Steel, as well as original Pebbles.\r\n- Fixed a bug where battery status can be incorrect for a small period of time when the watchface first appears.\r\n"},{"version":"2.0","published_date":"2014-02-17T17:08:00.547Z","release_notes":"Added a battery indicator"}],"companions":{"ios":null,"android":null},"compatibility":{"ios":{"supported":true,"min_js_version":-1},"android":{"supported":true},"aplite":{"supported":true,"firmware":{"major":2}},"basalt":{"supported":true,"firmware":{"major":3}},"chalk":{"supported":false,"firmware":{"major":3}},"diorite":{"supported":true,"firmware":{"major":3}},"emery":{"supported":true,"firmware":{"major":3}}},"created_at":"2014-02-06T17:25:10.965Z","description":"This watch face randomly generates 3 new pixel art images for your enjoyment, across the top of the face, every minute. The randomly generated objects may look like a castle turret, frog, strong man, space invader, guy with headphones and handle-bar mustache, etc. Whatever your mind makes of them. The watch face itself, is based on the 91w demo face, with touched-up pixels.
