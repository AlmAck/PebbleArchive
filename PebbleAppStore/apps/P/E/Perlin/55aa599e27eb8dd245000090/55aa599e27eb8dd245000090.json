Also replaced all images, and a new (clay) settings page.\r\n\r\n-----\r\nThis is a watchface developed to showcase the stunning digital artwork of Laurens Lapre - see the website link for full-size images.\r\n\r\nThe watchface, though simple in design,  will display 20 different background images, randomly changing each hour or minute.\r\n\r\nThere are also options to show/hide the date and battery level, and for bluetooth vibe and hourly vibe.  It supports 12 and 24 hour time.\r\n\r\nThe small black dot in the very middle is the bluetooth indicator.  It will disappear when bluetooth is lost.\r\n\r\n\r\nPerlin noise is a random sequence generator producing a more natural, harmonic succession of numbers than that of the standard random()function. It was invented by Ken Perlin in the 1980s and has been used in graphical applications to generate procedural textures, shapes, terrains, and other seemingly organic forms.","developer_id":"52d76309bd61272345000001","header_images":"","hearts":526,"id":"55aa599e27eb8dd245000090","latest_release":{"id":"57df3d1ca4c66dd786000021","js_md5":"20169e288dc22ac7f054889b48c3d821","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/wMBnjA29TDmjQsVBeQXG","published_date":"2016-09-19T01:19:50.844Z","release_notes":"sdk4","version":"2.0"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55aa599e27eb8dd245000090/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55aa599e27eb8dd245000090/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55aa599e27eb8dd245000090/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55aa599e27eb8dd245000090/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55aa599e27eb8dd245000090/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55aa599e27eb8dd245000090/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/55aa599e27eb8dd245000090"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/TC98xC3pTnmH45wiNQGE/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/TC98xC3pTnmH45wiNQGE/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-07-19T12:56:22.457Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/TC98xC3pTnmH45wiNQGE/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"https://github.com/mereed/pebbleface-perlin","title":"Perlin","type":"watchface","uuid":"6e909c30-2df7-4953-906f-cb40db4ee6d4","website":"http://laurenslapre.nl/ViewGradient/ViewGradient.html"}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
