With low battery level, seconds hand is automatically disabled.\r\n\r\nFollow the development here: http://forums.getpebble.com/discussion/26206/watchface-progress-time-for-pebble-time\r\n\r\nWeather data is fetched regularly, with shorter retry period if anything goes wrong. During the night the period is longer to conserve battery life.\r\n\r\nCustomization options:\r\n- disable wrist flick\r\n- continuously display battery level and bluetooth connection status\r\n- continuously display current time and date\r\n- use bold fonts\r\n- display day of week\r\n- date format\r\n- hour hand color\r\n- seconds hand\r\n- details display/lightup timeout\r\n- enable weather information display\r\n- disable GPS usage, enter fixed city name\r\n- configure weather update period\r\n- temperature units","developer_id":"5550a903e979afc9be000025","header_images":"","hearts":344,"id":"558c133c295a7df4c900008d","latest_release":{"id":"5698b8b7e541d8750c000024","js_md5":"2cef5623e8f86122b15abd9e93a87e32","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/tv0GGkbGQ6pd0ESLGZ7g","published_date":"2016-01-15T09:15:48.234Z","release_notes":"- fix displaying BT and battery icons","version":"2.02"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/558c133c295a7df4c900008d/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/558c133c295a7df4c900008d/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/558c133c295a7df4c900008d/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/558c133c295a7df4c900008d/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/558c133c295a7df4c900008d/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/558c133c295a7df4c900008d/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/558c133c295a7df4c900008d"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/p4cT1QNRy0oQPTNrzl6g/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/p4cT1QNRy0oQPTNrzl6g/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-06-30T08:42:15.873Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/p4cT1QNRy0oQPTNrzl6g/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"Progress Time","type":"watchface","uuid":"023b5e49-1248-4ce9-b19c-6a3a49861236","website":"http://kozelj.org/progress-time/"}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
