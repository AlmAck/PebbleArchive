Hopefully this makes it more reliable."},{"version":"2.9","published_date":"2015-10-27T01:17:41.364Z","release_notes":"Added api key for openweathermap.org."},{"version":"2.8","published_date":"2015-08-15T04:26:19.032Z","release_notes":"Fixed code that was not working with 2.3 release and causing the watchface to freeze when settings or colors updated. Hopefully fixed bug with weather icons sometimes going blank."},{"version":"2.7","published_date":"2015-08-08T05:26:31.920Z","release_notes":"Changed update method for settings and color changes based on day/night. Should stop the freezing that started happening with the pebble 2.3 update."},{"version":"2.6","published_date":"2015-08-08T12:57:17.849Z","release_notes":"Changed key for temperature communication. This should fix the temperature getting overridden to 0. Still looking for a bug that seems to only happen on a fresh load. "},{"version":"2.5","published_date":"2015-06-23T06:07:51.264Z","release_notes":"Bug fixes: Through working on an upcoming app I found I was not handling images correctly. Now I am properly checking to make sure I don't create the same image more than once and I only delete images that exist. Hopefully this fixes the behavior that sometimes instead of honoring a button press it stays on the watch and the temperature goes to 0 (I only saw this on the color version, but I am still doing things better now). I will continue to investigate if I manage to get that behavior again."},{"version":"2.4","published_date":"2015-06-22T20:28:57.360Z","release_notes":"Big fix. I had some typos that were causing 1 or 2 open weather map icons to not show. "},{"version":"2.3","published_date":"2015-06-22T16:40:27.702Z","release_notes":"Centered date information. I think it looks a little better."},{"version":"2.2","published_date":"2015-06-21T12:26:41.807Z","release_notes":"User request: added a setting to switch to Day-Month order on the date.\r\n\r\nMenu icons and names are being adjusted so that my watchfaces are more easily identifiable. The shrunk screenshot is not super helpful if you are switching between the full to get more information and lite versions to save battery. The menu icon will now have the initials of the Precisioneer type (P for Precisioneer)."},{"version":"2.1","published_date":"2015-06-07T14:51:35.878Z","release_notes":"Spelling is hard..."},{"version":"2.0","published_date":"2015-06-07T14:26:28.217Z","release_notes":"Major Update! Now you can get a free API key for weather underground and vastly improve the quality of your weather reporting! To get your key go to: http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/d/login.html More instructions are in the description of the settings page. You will see new icons when you use this free setting! If you do not have a key you will still get openweathermap.org weather. Majorly improved loading efficiency and memory usage by only loading images when they are needed. Improved the reliability of getting weather. The biggest failure was the phone not responding with a location, so now it will keep asking until it gets a response! Fixed a potential bug where you would get Celsius temperature even if you selected Fahrenheit.\r\nChanged openweathermap request to high low temperature instead of day/night avg temp. Changed the day/night icon to red up arrow/down blue arrow. Updated menu icon with new layout, thought it is so small maybe that does not matter.\r\n\r\nAdded a battery charging icon."},{"version":"1.7","published_date":"2015-06-04T02:20:37.447Z","release_notes":"Major overhaul of the calls to internet weather. Now it will not attempt an update if it did so in the last 17 minutes. It will attempt to update when the watchface is loaded and every 20 minutes (at 7, 27, and 47 minutes past the hour). This fixes a bug where weather was called multiple times in a row due to timing issues and should make the weather more reliable. Limiting the possible calls during the day also opens up the possibility for calling a more reliable weather provider... Stay tuned for an update."},{"version":"1.6","published_date":"2015-05-27T03:42:58.643Z","release_notes":"Changed the name from the [apparently] trademark infringing \"Pebleneer\" to [hopefully] not law breaking \"Precisioneer.\""},{"version":"1.5","published_date":"2015-05-19T04:12:24.021Z","release_notes":"Shrunk icon to show the whole watchface instead of just the corner of the watchface. The text is a little sketchy, but hopefully it gets the point across."},{"version":"1.4","published_date":"2015-05-09T01:43:48.526Z","release_notes":"Cleaned up double save of weather from a settings change. Updated menu screenshot."},{"version":"1.3","published_date":"2015-05-07T07:33:15.861Z","release_notes":"Fixed a bug that the temperature reverted to C if updated from a settings change.\r\nAdded persistent weather, i.e. no more blank screens after the initial load! It will load last known good value. I originally thought you would come back hours later and the weather would be inaccurate, but I found it is common to go back and forth and sometimes the communication does not straiten out with the phone until the 30 minute update, so now it will load last known good value. "},{"version":"1.2","published_date":"2015-05-03T11:31:42.576Z","release_notes":"Fixed a missing \"break\" statement. Moved battery level text down a couple pixels to make it better centered with the icon.\r\nStill crashes the first time it is loaded to the watch from the settings and weather websites being called at the same time..."},{"version":"1.1","published_date":"2015-04-18T13:29:04.333Z","release_notes":"Streamlined Phone to Watch communication.\r\nWaiting to request first weather until java script on phone is ready. Hopefully this fixes the bug where sometimes the phone does not respond. If weather does not load, still check openweathermap.org as the free site sometimes does not respond, especially if you have been switching between screens and making a lot of requests with the same ip address. Please wait about 1 minute before retrying to give the website a chance to respond.\r\n\r\nStill has the weird issue where it crashes due to the settings page being automatically called when the app is loaded... Need to investigate further."}],"companions":{"ios":null,"android":null},"compatibility":{"ios":{"supported":true,"min_js_version":25},"android":{"supported":true},"aplite":{"supported":true,"firmware":{"major":2}},"basalt":{"supported":true,"firmware":{"major":3}},"chalk":{"supported":false,"firmware":{"major":3}},"diorite":{"supported":true,"firmware":{"major":3}},"emery":{"supported":true,"firmware":{"major":3}}},"created_at":"2015-03-25T03:56:05.263Z","description":"Data for those who need to know precisely how you want it.
