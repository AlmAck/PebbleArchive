Palma Watch brings the best of both worlds. :) Shaking your hand brings all important weather data (icons for each 6 hours of next one and half day, current temperature [Â°C], low and high temperature of next 24 hours, atmospheric pressure compared to normal, humidity, Beaufort scale and wind direction, sunrise and sunset) from OpenWeatherMap as well as location and weather info time stamp (to check if you have current data). After returning to clock, you find a new picture smiling at you. \r\nIn top right corner two horizontal bars show battery charge and your progress toward 5000-step daily goal, respectively. A running shoe appears when goal reached and 'STEP' vibrates in Morse code.  Losing Bluetooth connection prompts vibration of 'B' in Morse code, and BT pic appears. Getting extreme weather conditions prompts 'SOS' Morse code vibration. \r\nThe 5000-step goal seems arbitrary, but take into consideration, that Pebble Health has limitations: a/ counts perfectly the number of steps during walks, b/ seriously underestimates (up to 50% false negative) steps during jogging or running, c/ overestimates steps in vibrating environment (false positive reading during driving or traveling, doing handiwork). Altogether, 5000 steps measured by Pebble Health corresponds a healthy daily walk.","developer_id":"56e0bffce37666e7af000028","header_images":"","hearts":4,"id":"571938249b1a749f52000019","latest_release":{"id":"5724f99ac08db0d681000013","js_md5":"245086031e76b5b9af90f8562648aafb","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/piophQwPQeedtkXiSexB","published_date":"2016-04-30T18:30:03.090Z","release_notes":"3.2 Bugfix.","version":"3.2"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/571938249b1a749f52000019/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/571938249b1a749f52000019/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/571938249b1a749f52000019/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/571938249b1a749f52000019/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/571938249b1a749f52000019/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/571938249b1a749f52000019/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/571938249b1a749f52000019"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/WFMqM5jkSMikZX8y25mW/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/WFMqM5jkSMikZX8y25mW/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2016-04-25T14:33:18.719Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/WFMqM5jkSMikZX8y25mW/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/T2q7Br4oQp2VEKLVilOZ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/6XiKXpCTRQueEWuCVPCE/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"Palma Watch","type":"watchface","uuid":"52748a02-f3b2-47e3-91ac-6a9e04874428","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
