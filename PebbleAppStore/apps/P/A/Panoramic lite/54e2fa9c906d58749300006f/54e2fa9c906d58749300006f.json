This version is designed to go easy on the battery.\r\nFor the one with seconds, check out my other watchface Panoramic.\r\n\r\nA beautiful (imho) and functional watchface, showing a panoramic view of Mountains. I designed the watchface to be minimal, but still include all the function I need on a daily basis like the date and weekday.  The watchface includes bluetooth disconnect notification, by vibrating twice when the watch loses the connection and vibrating once when the phone is connected again.  \r\n\r\nIf you like the watchface, please heart it.","developer_id":"5499d00473268f31cd000104","hearts":57,"id":"54e2fa9c906d58749300006f","latest_release":{"id":"54e4da2ad412a83fde0000c2","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/IGXsGfUpT16CMLMMrXuA","published_date":"2015-02-18T18:30:19.048Z","release_notes":"fixed length of date string","version":"1.1"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54e2fa9c906d58749300006f/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54e2fa9c906d58749300006f/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54e2fa9c906d58749300006f/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54e2fa9c906d58749300006f/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54e2fa9c906d58749300006f/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54e2fa9c906d58749300006f/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/54e2fa9c906d58749300006f"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/ylcfQm0MRBOkNkv24Rmy/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/ylcfQm0MRBOkNkv24Rmy/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-02-17T08:25:13.693Z","screenshot_hardware":"aplite","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/ylcfQm0MRBOkNkv24Rmy/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"Panoramic lite","type":"watchface","uuid":"82f43a87-c6d3-4750-ac8d-2f4551484429","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
