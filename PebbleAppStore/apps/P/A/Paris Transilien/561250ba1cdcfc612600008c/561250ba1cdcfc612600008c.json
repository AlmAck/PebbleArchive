Transilien™ is the brand name of the suburban railway service of the SNCF-owned railway network operating within the Île-de-France.\r\n\r\nMain features:\r\n1. This app lets you search Transilien train timetables.\r\n2. Information includs departure / pass time, destinations, \"Delayed / Canceled\" status, stops, and the time of each stop.\r\n3. Search a station name by choosing letters directly on your wrist. For example, you can find Saint-Lazare by only searching \"AZA\".\r\n4. Long select the search result to add a destination.\r\n5. You can reverse the direction in case you want a return trip.\r\n6. By selecting a train, you can check its schedules and stops.\r\n7. Add your daily itineraries into favorites.\r\n8. Long select a favorite to edit or reorder.\r\n9. The connection indicator in the status bar lets you know if it's ready to load timetables.\r\n10. A soft vibration tells you the loading is finished and successful. \r\n11. \"Low Memory\" warning with a triple vibration let you know there's not enough memory to open a new window.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions / requests / suggestions, please contact me by mail, or leave an issue in the GitHub project page.
