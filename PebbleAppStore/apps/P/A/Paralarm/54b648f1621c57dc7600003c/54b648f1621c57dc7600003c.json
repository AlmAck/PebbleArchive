It is essential for a paraplegic to catheterize each 6 hours maximum in order to empty the bladder and avoid Urinary Tract Infection (UTI). Also, a paraplegic should make push-ups on his/her wheelchair (or change position if in bed) every two hours maximum in order to avoid pressure sores. This application vibrates when one of these time laps occurs and it keeps track of the last Catheterization (Cath) time and the last Pressure Relief (PR) time; by showing them on the screen of the Pebble Watch.  With just a push of a button, the time of the action (Pressure relief or Catheterisation) is registered on the screen. The ‘UP’ Button is used to register the time when you Catheterise, the ‘MIDDLE’ Button is used to register the time when you change position or make a push up, the ‘DOWN’ Button is used to silence and stops the vibration when it occurs, the ‘BACK’ Button exits the app if necessary.\r\nIn the current settings, the time lap for a pressure relief is 2 hours. The time lap for a catheterisation is 5 hours and 30 minutes. On each time lap the user is notified via a vibration of the watch that lasts around 30 seconds.","developer_id":"52e0dbf37f68b3152b0000f4","header_images":[{"orig":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/Uk1nEO9MSKkN0gZqxb0X/convert?cache=true&fit=crop","720x320":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/Uk1nEO9MSKkN0gZqxb0X/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=720&h=320"},{"orig":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/CaDHzJzKSN6L0g34g78b/convert?cache=true&fit=crop","720x320":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/CaDHzJzKSN6L0g34g78b/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=720&h=320"}],"hearts":9,"icon_image":{"28x28":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/PLRR7m2SxyLQKSXesHGv/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=28&h=28","48x48":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/PLRR7m2SxyLQKSXesHGv/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=48&h=48"},"id":"54b648f1621c57dc7600003c","latest_release":{"id":"54eca3a4d9c53bac4c000087","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/MhBX6S8rTLWCsTzmCegh","published_date":"2015-02-24T16:29:47.153Z","release_notes":"In this version, Paralarm application can run in the background!","version":"1.3"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54b648f1621c57dc7600003c/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54b648f1621c57dc7600003c/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54b648f1621c57dc7600003c/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54b648f1621c57dc7600003c/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54b648f1621c57dc7600003c/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54b648f1621c57dc7600003c/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/54b648f1621c57dc7600003c"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/wjUeZoDURaeNhkalnnEv/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/wjUeZoDURaeNhkalnnEv/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-01-14T10:59:51.952Z","screenshot_hardware":"aplite","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/ef0IxDHdRaWsSxO3Lz9A/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/pIYEB44Rp2dC6FdsVjHb/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/2svbfHzGSdSw83agVWR9/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/zHagxi87Tuaoxgsh3yEw/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/49w4CvTFRaaoR7SADuS6/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"Paralarm","type":"watchapp","uuid":"a8f85123-4497-47ff-8800-69b37e77979f","website":"http://www.paraplegicanonymous.org"}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
