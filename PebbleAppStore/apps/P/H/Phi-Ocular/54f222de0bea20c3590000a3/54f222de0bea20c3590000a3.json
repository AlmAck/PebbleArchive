These change from the background to foreground color as the hours increase.  \r\nAs the hours light up, they include smaller rings positioned appropriately as per an analog display (this creates the Phi-like spiral). These are filled to show the 5-minute positions and these continue beyond the hour rings if the 5-minutes exceed the hours.  The 5-minutes are displayed in the inverse colour to that of the hour rings.\r\nSingle minutes are show by four smaller rings that appear in the twelve o'clock position, again with inverse fill as the minutes increase. \r\n\r\nThere is a choice of foreground color on the configuration page.\r\n  \r\nScreenshots show:  9:31, 12:59, 7:45, 8:04\r\n  \r\nThis design was created by Peter Fletcher and originally appeared on the Tokyoflash Design Studio.   it is published with the designer's permission, and sanctioned by Tokyoflash.   \r\n\r\nThe original design can be found here: \r\nhttp://blog.tokyoflash.com/2013/06/27/phi-ocular-could-be-watching-you/","developer_id":"54547c1fe77c14d0a1000033","header_images":"","hearts":14,"id":"54f222de0bea20c3590000a3","latest_release":{"id":"56c9c81563d1f645e3000022","js_md5":"a631defefeda94b15fe7702bd95d85ca","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/5eEPqrHhQhqE10Y21qRX","published_date":"2016-02-21T14:22:24.467Z","release_notes":"Added color and round support.
