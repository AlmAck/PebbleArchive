Supporting many cities worldwide now with buses and all transit realtime correction!  For more information, check out GetMeThereTransitApp.com\r\n\r\n\r\nRealtime Philadelphia rapid rail transit information.

Lines include the Market Frankford Line, Broad Street Line, Broad-Ridge Spur, PATCO High Speed Line, Regional Rail (Between Jefferson and University City).\r\n\r\nWith update 1.1 you may now select two regional rail stations and view trains traveling between them. You can also set a line as a favorite and have it displayed at the top of the list when in range. (These are premium features)\r\n\r\nAn update in the near future will add support for the Norristown High Speed Line as well as Trolley Routes.\r\n\r\nCheck: chrisschlitt.com/PhillyTransit for more information.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: Trip Planning Data and Stop Information belongs to SEPTA and PATCO.
