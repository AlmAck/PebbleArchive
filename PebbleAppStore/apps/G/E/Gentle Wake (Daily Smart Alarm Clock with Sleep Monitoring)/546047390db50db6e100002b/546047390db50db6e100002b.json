It also has a distinct alarm pattern.\r\n- Get Out Of Bed Alarm has 2 modes that you toggle through in the settings: \r\n1) X Minutes after alarm start for those of us who are habitual snoozers\r\n2) X Minutes after stopping alarm for those that manage to turn off the alarm in their sleep even with Konami Code enabled\r\n\r\nNew Feature: Auto-Close - Automatically closes Gentle Wake after X minutes of inactivity (no button presses, no active alarm or snoozing, etc) which goes back to your default watch face."},{"version":"2.8","published_date":"2015-12-17T06:33:28.050Z","release_notes":"Fixed alarms and graphical glitches on original Pebbles using the new v3 firmware (with Timeline).

The Pebble OS APIs currently do not handle DST changes, so due to the various DST rules around the world, which change regularly, the app now wakes once a week to check for DST changes and adjust alarms if necessary. By default this is at 4am on Sundays, but this can be changed in the settings in the app if your country changes over on a different day. If Gentle Wake was not open before the DST Check then it immediately closes so it should not interfere with anything running.\r\n\r\nAlso improved skipping alarms (hold Up on main screen with no active alarm) so up to 6 days can be skipped by repeatedly holding and releasing the Up button. Holding Up after 6 days skipped, cycles back to no skips and disabling & re-enabling alarms or changing settings also resets the skipping."},{"version":"1.7","published_date":"2014-12-30T01:37:00.740Z","release_notes":"Fixed 12PM appearing as 12AM, oops..."},{"version":"1.6","published_date":"2014-11-26T01:57:04.381Z","release_notes":"Improved error message when wakeup API fails"},{"version":"1.5","published_date":"2014-11-22T03:32:08.756Z","release_notes":"Improved feedback when skipping next alarm"},{"version":"1.4","published_date":"2014-11-21T05:20:29.402Z","release_notes":"Hold up button on main screen to toggle skipping next alarm (so you don't have to remember to re-enable alarms for one exception)"},{"version":"1.3","published_date":"2014-11-16T03:23:50.566Z","release_notes":"Improved robustness in setting wakeup"},{"version":"1.2","published_date":"2014-11-15T02:24:29.079Z","release_notes":"Added sensitivity setting for the Smart Alarm"},{"version":"1.1","published_date":"2014-11-13T05:11:03.344Z","release_notes":"Added clearer instructions for stopping alarm and made recovery from forced exit better"}],"companions":{"ios":null,"android":null},"compatibility":{"ios":{"supported":true,"min_js_version":-1},"android":{"supported":true},"aplite":{"supported":true,"firmware":{"major":2}},"basalt":{"supported":true,"firmware":{"major":3}},"chalk":{"supported":true,"firmware":{"major":3}},"diorite":{"supported":true,"firmware":{"major":3}},"emery":{"supported":true,"firmware":{"major":3}}},"created_at":"2014-11-10T05:03:53.978Z","description":"- Alarms for each day of the week\r\n- Smart Alarm attempts to wake you if it detects you stirring shortly before the alarm time, which is the Monitor Period (doesn't interfere with background activity apps)\r\n- All settings are in-app (Down button on main screen) \r\n- Alarm vibration starts gentle and gets longer and longer to gradually wake you and this can be adjusted with the Vibration Pattern setting\r\n- Alarm will vibrate for just over a minute and will then auto-snooze to save battery\r\n- Doesn't need to be manually started for the alarms to work (set and forget)\r\n- While Alarm is vibrating, a single click on any button snoozes the alarm. 2 quick clicks are required by to turn off the alarm to reduce the chance of accidentally turning it off\r\n- Change the 'Stop Alarm' setting to 'Konami Code' to show a random sequence of buttons to turn off the alarm to help really make sure you are awake\r\n- Dynamic snooze halves the initial snooze time on each snooze until it reaches 3 minutes - for those of us with a habit of hitting snooze repeatedly ;)\r\n- Can temporarily disable all alarms (Single Up button click on main screen)\r\n- 'Easy Light' - hold your Pebble vertically to turn on the backlight while the alarm is vibrating/snoozing (no need to shake your wrist!).
