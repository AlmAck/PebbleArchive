Previous version changes:\r\n\r\nOptimized memory usage: gracefully handle most Out-of-Memory (OOM) conditions; decreased AppMessage buffer size. Should now work way better and stop crashing, especially on Aplite platform. Sometimes you will see <OOM> labels here and there; this means that you either have many tasklists or have many tasks / tasks with large notes in current list. Note that Time series watch have more memory available and will seldom suffer of this issue.
