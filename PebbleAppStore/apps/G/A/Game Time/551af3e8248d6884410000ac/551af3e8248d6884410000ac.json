Game Time is a tribute to the Nintendo Gameboy Color, in honor of the new Pebble Time. Configurable colors and games allow you to mix and match to perfectly recreate your favorite memories. Each game has special built-in behavior as well. Much thanks to Valeriy Lashmanov for the original B/W Tetris Time code, Denis Dzyubenko for inspiring the Mario Jump design, and Christian Freimann and his PokeBattle watchface for inspiring the ones used here. \r\n\r\nCompatible for Pebble Classic! B/W screens will see a Gameboy Classic with Splash Screen watchface.
