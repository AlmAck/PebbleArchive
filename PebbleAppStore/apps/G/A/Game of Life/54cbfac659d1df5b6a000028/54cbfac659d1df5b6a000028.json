Shake the watch to reset the game to one of three initial setups.\r\n\r\nRules of the Game of Life:\r\nFor each cycle of the game...\r\n- A live (black) square remains live if and only if it has exactly 2 or 3 live neighbors. Otherwise it dies (turns white)\r\n- A non-live square becomes live if it has exactly 3 neighbors. Otherwise it stays non-live\r\n\r\nNote: A portion of the code for this watchface was taken from the tutorial on the pebble website, since it was created by modifying that tutorial","developer_id":"5343952817842f00fb000039","hearts":12,"id":"54cbfac659d1df5b6a000028","latest_release":{"id":"54cbfb260a912f356a000038","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/jwNeZkwhSW6s02qJg5Ax","published_date":"2015-01-30T21:44:48.252Z","release_notes":"First Release\r\nShake the watch to reset the initial setup to one of 3 different settings!","version":"1.0"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54cbfac659d1df5b6a000028/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54cbfac659d1df5b6a000028/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54cbfac659d1df5b6a000028/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54cbfac659d1df5b6a000028/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54cbfac659d1df5b6a000028/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/54cbfac659d1df5b6a000028/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/54cbfac659d1df5b6a000028"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/EYSmZegZTK7wuwTAPAtt/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/EYSmZegZTK7wuwTAPAtt/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-01-30T21:46:00.805Z","screenshot_hardware":"aplite","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/EYSmZegZTK7wuwTAPAtt/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/Y5OjdocyT1uAHHiX9f8G/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/rIPXqP7OSO6HQySj0euA/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/LWGsYjviRme1kQl2xRr3/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/9tmsOQ04RmWZUHDqgm2v/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"https://github.com/nduchan/Conway","title":"Game of Life","type":"watchface","uuid":"24d6da4a-80c4-4698-af00-c5a703683284","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
