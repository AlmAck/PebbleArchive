It only runs when you tilt your Pebble (more than 45degree).\r\n\r\n§ The color of hands shows states each of active and idle:\r\n❑  Red: Active, show second-hand only 6 seconds. (If you hold tilting your wrist, second hand keep working)\r\n❑  Black: Idle, without screen-refresh but able to detect tilt.\r\n\r\n§  If Pebble is upside downed and hold it 2 seconds, this watchface goes into sleep mode. A weak vibe let you know that it is on sleeping.\r\n\r\n❑ On sleeping mode, gray colored background will be appeared and sensor does not detect your tilt action.\r\n❑ To wake up,  turn your wrist once quickly or give a tap. shaking arms may not work properly.\r\n❑ Then an animation will be shown winding hands from the point of sleeping to current time.\r\n\r\nNote: \"Bluetooth connection warning\" feature removed from v1.1\r\n","developer_id":"52d86b77aef8d5b10700001b","header_images":"","hearts":56,"id":"558999a4133ae759810000f7","latest_release":{"id":"56fc0c1a085b3d53a900003d","js_md5":"4375ae68c3e1c5eb98d86d65035586be","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/o0dVyfIxRNypsjS1gVS2","published_date":"2016-03-30T17:25:52.606Z","release_notes":"bug fixed","version":"1.6"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/558999a4133ae759810000f7/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/558999a4133ae759810000f7/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/558999a4133ae759810000f7/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/558999a4133ae759810000f7/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/558999a4133ae759810000f7/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/558999a4133ae759810000f7/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/558999a4133ae759810000f7"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/kF7U9RIVT3BqNjIxBubZ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/kF7U9RIVT3BqNjIxBubZ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2016-03-18T16:53:58.050Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/kF7U9RIVT3BqNjIxBubZ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/lRo4zCjBTQCYilMmCyhn/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/ONvSjXW9RKTCVzQKc3OQ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"Glimmer","type":"watchface","uuid":"303602d5-228f-48a0-a32b-0e4ef8b39f5c","website":"http://andrwj.com/wiki/Glimmer"}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
