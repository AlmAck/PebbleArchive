Make a bookmark. Return without getting lost.\r\n\r\nThis is not a full-blown navigation software. It simply tells you the distance (as the crow flies) and direction to your destination. I made it for finding my tent while drunk at night at a heavy metal festival. Might also work for pop festivals or huge parking lots.\r\n\r\nInstructions:\r\n- Enable high accuracy GPS mode on your phone.\r\n- Long-press any of the three buttons on the right to save your current location.\r\n- Short-press a button to select a previously saved destination.\r\n- When the compass arrows are only shown as outline or not shown at all, you need to calibrate the compass. Rotate your Pebble in all directions until the arrows become visible and filled. (This may take some patience.)\r\n- When the big arrow turns into a second circle, you are pretty close to your destination. At this time, you should stop looking at your watch and instead look for any physical objects in your vicinity that might provide clues as to where you are, and maybe even why you thought it might be a good idea to come here. Trust yourself. You probably had a reason. Maybe even a good one.\r\n- To exit the app, double-click the back button.\r\n\r\nFeedback welcome!\r\n\r\nPlanned features:\r\n- Better GPS error handling","developer_id":"54f396182eee75ef250000ba","header_images":[{"orig":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/gJaLj2JNRHau7eJAv9Oj/convert?cache=true&fit=crop","720x320":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/gJaLj2JNRHau7eJAv9Oj/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=720&h=320"}],"hearts":145,"icon_image":{"28x28":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/04J46wkTnamRtV9pxLsH/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=28&h=28","48x48":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/04J46wkTnamRtV9pxLsH/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=48&h=48"},"id":"55775398691b9bc76e00007c","latest_release":{"id":"56476bb8246053e26300008e","js_md5":"3bb489820ec4f7528e4e2e88a27f161f","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/rkSN04ZSbiKSoehopd4w","published_date":"2015-11-14T17:18:29.453Z","release_notes":"- Support Chalk Platform (Pebble Time Round)\r\n- Always show filled (instead of hollow) compass arrows, even when the compass is not fully calibrated.","version":"1.5"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55775398691b9bc76e00007c/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55775398691b9bc76e00007c/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55775398691b9bc76e00007c/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55775398691b9bc76e00007c/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55775398691b9bc76e00007c/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/55775398691b9bc76e00007c/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/55775398691b9bc76e00007c"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/puzwdDWHSN299RurvsrC/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/puzwdDWHSN299RurvsrC/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-06-09T21:27:06.134Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/0kUjfNbgRUCFy5HnSrrg/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/wmoBpbuT2Kb6KPx4QyOQ/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/SeqEHLUpTkqqMWKDEHje/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"GPS Bookmark","type":"watchapp","uuid":"accbffd1-6655-40a7-a342-dda79446acf0","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
