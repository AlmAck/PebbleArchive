This should be no more than six seconds, but in practice it can be much longer.   See the source code link if you're interested.\r\n\r\nIf you try this, please let me know the results you get from it and what type of phone you have (model, OS version) by emailing gpstester@summers.aus.net.\r\n\r\nI'll post a summary of results in this description.\r\n\r\nYes, this may look slightly familiar.  No, I didn't write it from scratch.  :-)","developer_id":"544f79d4ba44304f8400004c","hearts":5,"id":"5531a1c65b5f5463d000007e","latest_release":{"id":"5531a2d946a15c3e6800007f","js_md5":"161de03d3008fa8543710d748707d66a","js_version":28,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/gwOsJbZ5QViNGLM4rgiq","published_date":"2015-04-18T00:18:46.893Z","release_notes":"First (and probably only) version.","version":"1.0"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5531a1c65b5f5463d000007e/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5531a1c65b5f5463d000007e/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5531a1c65b5f5463d000007e/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5531a1c65b5f5463d000007e/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5531a1c65b5f5463d000007e/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/5531a1c65b5f5463d000007e/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/5531a1c65b5f5463d000007e"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/uqlT7G0yTEa5sMBw5VtC/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/uqlT7G0yTEa5sMBw5VtC/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2015-04-18T00:19:00.354Z","screenshot_hardware":"aplite","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/uqlT7G0yTEa5sMBw5VtC/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"http://web.aanet.com.au/~summersfamily/gps_tester.zip","title":"GPS Tester","type":"watchface","uuid":"14654975-4fe1-4008-a3de-e86e88782afd","website":""}],"limit":20,"offset":0,"links":{"nextPage":null}}
