The green background changes to yellow, if less than three hours are remaining, and to red, if it is less than one hour.\r\n\r\nFor example: you know you're able to work till 22:00 (10 PM). You set 22:00 in the configuration. At 8:30 in the morning you will see 13:30 remaining.\r\n\r\nIt works with working over the midnight.
