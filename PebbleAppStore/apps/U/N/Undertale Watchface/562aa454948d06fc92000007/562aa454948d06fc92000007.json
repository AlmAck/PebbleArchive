This is whats known as a good problem I think. The weather data from this new API is different but not less accurate, they pull weather data from different spots."},{"version":"1.5","published_date":"2015-10-27T19:46:22.100Z","release_notes":"- Made weather updates only on shake event to save calls to phone (battery life)\r\n- Removed old weather info while fetching new info so its easier to see that it succeeded and you have new temperature reading\r\n---\r\n- At this point the watchface is working just as I envisioned it so this will be the last update for a while. Next update will bring compatibility with other Pebble products, hidden secrets (if i can get them working correctly!), and other goodies.\r\n\r\nThank you so much to everyone that has liked and installed this! This is my first attempt at programming for the Pebble and I learned a lot. Thank you thank you thank you!\r\n"},{"version":"1.4","published_date":"2015-10-26T04:52:10.781Z","release_notes":"- Removed spooky surprise, it needs a couple more rounds of testing"},{"version":"1.2","published_date":"2015-10-26T04:08:28.560Z","release_notes":"Ditched psleep for much better AppTimer method!
