Some time slots have fixed events, while others are randomly chosen from a group (some rarer than others). Upon Bluetooth disconnect, the time digits will turn red. \r\n\r\nIf there is enough interest, I plan to add some animations and additional backgrounds (more random events + unpleasant encounters for those who stay up too late...).\r\n\r\nInspired by (and all assets taken from) tobyfox's Undertale. Grab the free demo and try it out! \r\n\r\nThis watchface contains spoilers.","developer_id":"532023baef6e77dabd00003c","header_images":"","hearts":217,"id":"56a575357a47390261000007","latest_release":{"id":"56aefa5c3076f5ae6100001f","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/PefVhqrR4qeAM6DBB8H2","published_date":"2016-02-01T06:25:50.464Z","release_notes":"Version 2.0: Adds aplite compatibility for the OG Pebbles!
