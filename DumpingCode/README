To run these, you need ArdaLib, which you can download here: https://github.com/ardaozkal/ArdaLib/releases/

Please keep in mind that I wrote the code in 4am local time, so while it works, it's not the prettiest code ever.

I already dumped languages, and they're available in /LanguageFiles/ and Firmwares in /Firmware/Extra/

Enjoy
